    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <p>
      A profile is generally understood as representing a point of view. In information technology, profiles may also
      support the data needs of specific applications. Profiling is often the work of a community interested in
      interoperability and data exchange. We define a profile generally as named set of constraints on one or more
      identified base specifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Communities create and use data standards to ensure interoperability for information exchange. Although members
      of a community may use the same basic standard schema, it is very common for different subsets within the larger
      community to need some further specification of the data they create to meet their own needs. To continue to
      support interoperability of their data with others, these community members need to express the specifics of
      their implementation of the data schema. Profiles serve this purpose. Profiles enumerate vocabulary terms,
      cardinality, and validation rules, and can also include descriptions of the rules used by creators to make
      decisions regarding their data elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good metadata practice begins with the builders of vocabularies and ontologies. Builders of vocabularies and
      ontologies are encouraged to make their work as broadly applicable as possible so as to maximize future adoption.
      As a result, vocabularies and ontologies typically define a data model using minimal semantics. For example,
      DCAT [[vocab-dcat-2]] defines the concept of a dataset as an abstract entity with distributions and data services
      as means of accessing data; it is silent on whether a distribution should be in a particular serialization, or
      set of serializations. It is also silent on how data services should be configured. While it states that the
      value of dcat:theme should be a SKOS [[skos-reference]] concept, it does not specify a particular SKOS concept
      scheme, and so on. Other vocabularies, such as Dublin Core Terms [[DCTERMS]], are equally parsimonious in their
      prescriptions of how they should be used. This means that data models and methods of working can be applied in
      different circumstances than those in which the original definition work was carried out and, in that sense,
      these promote broad interoperability.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to addressing the needs of a specific community, a profile may also apply to a single system. Any
      individual system will be designed to meet a specific set of needs; that is, it will operate in a specific
      context. It is that context, and the individual choices made by the engineers working within it, that will
      determine how a vocabulary or set of vocabularies will be used. For example, a system ingesting data may require
      that a specific subset of properties from a range of vocabularies is used and that only terms from a defined code
      list are used as values for specified properties. In other words, where the 'base vocabulary' might say "the
      value of this property SHOULD be a value from a managed code list", a specialized profile will say "the value of
      this property MUST be from this specific code list".
    </p>
    <p>
      This document is about how to formulate and communicate profiles.

      <h3>Types and profiles and related work</h3>
        <div class="note"><p>
      (Antoine:) The idea is that this section will contain text the define the types of profiles and their motivation in general terms, 
          as well as pointing to examples, as done at <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/435#issuecomment-426928897">in this draft</a>. As Karen said:</p>
          <p>(Karen:) I had thought of this as showing examples of TYPES of profiles. There are profiles like DCAT that take place 
            within a community, make primary use of a base metadata schema, but add or remove based on local need. There are profiles 
            like ODRL that have a very formal meaning (legal license) and are in essence cumulative, with the base standard elements 
            assumed and specific rules for over-riding. There are profiles that use only the namespace of the base profile, but are 
            defined subsets (BIBFRA.ME, but any other example of this would be fine - that's the one I know). And then we could perhaps 
            find a profile that has no strong base profile (ADMS perhaps?) but combines elements as needed from a variety of sources and 
            is independent of any existing vocabulary. The idea would be to show a range of profile motivations, designs, and community 
            involvement.</p>

        <em>Profiling</em> is an activity that has been undertaken by many communities with a range of formalisms. This

      <h2>What is a profile?</h2>
      <p>This section builds on the formal definition for <a>profile</a> and the requirements DXWG has identified, and lays down a conceptual model for profiles, their components 
        and their functions.</p>
      <p>A Profile is based on an existing Specification, which can have the status of a Standard and which can be itself 
        a Profile of another Specification. A profile can have various Components/Manifestations in various expression languages for profiles.
        These Components/Manifestations play specific Functions (roles) for the implementation of the services that motivate the creation of the Profile. 
        These Components are serialized and published as Distributions in various formats, which are the concrete input for performing these services.
        </p>
         <div class="note"><p>
      (Antoine:) Obviously at this stage some names in this model have to be finalized. 
           We will also provide with a diagram that shows our 'big picture' on profiles and their possible (or recommended) components. Something at the level of the diagram at https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1dHkpwKwUwMgS1RqSCTPO3uOoRiY_qNk0z5bhXJlYi4Y/, which should work as an abstracted version of the prof-o model https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/profilesont/ (i.e. one without classes and properties that come from a specific namespace/vocabulary.
    </div>
  </div>  
     <p>The W3C DXWG has identified general requirements about profiles, which we list here and are going to expand upon (in more detailed requirements and recommendations) in the following section:</p>
     <div class="note"><p>
      (Antoine:) Once the structure is stabilized this section should list the other sections it 'introduces'. 
              Maybe these sections will be moved as sub-sections of this one.</p>
  </div>  
    <div class="note">(Antoine:) From https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/435#issue-366191828:
        <ul>
          <li>A profile MUST be published to the relevant metadata-using community</li>
          <li>A profile MAY be based on one or more known community standards, for interoperability within that community 
            (&quot;profile of X&quot;), and, when it is, it must indicate that basis</li>
          <li>A profile MAY combine vocabularies that cross community boundaries without having any strongly identifiable base 
            profile or profiles</li>
          <li>A profile MAY be expressed in more than one physical file</li>
	  <li>(etc. here until we finalize requirements - these are just examples)</li>

      <div class="note">(Antoine:) From the 24 Oct discussion in Lyon, but it looks redundant with one of the above:

      <h2>The Functions of Profile Components/Manifestations</h2>
      <p>A Component/Manifestion of a Profile can play a number of Functions (Roles) for the performing of a service.

      serialized in a specific format)</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A profile MUST define vocabulary terms that are used in the metadata being profiled.</li>

	  <li>Human-readable labels and definitions MUST be included for vocabulary terms</li>
          <li>Vocabulary terms SHOULD be defined as mandatory, optional, repeatable, not repeatable (alt.: cardinality rules for vocabulary terms SHOULD be defined in the profile)</li>
	  <li>The profile MAY include input instructions for metadata creators (and to aid users in understanding the deeper meaning of terms)</li>

      (Antoine:) What I have in mind for this section is to introduce the DXWG Profiles ontology. Say how it can support the requirements we identified, point to it, and suggest to use in contexts where an RDF / Linked Data description of the profiles and their associated resources can be made. If it's non-normative, it should be presented as a possible approach to implementing our recommendations, for example using a sentence like <i>The machine-readable version of the metadata on profiles and their links to associated resources may be provided using the Profiles ontology developed by the DXWG working group</i> (shamelessly inspired from how we've done it in the DWBP doc at https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#quality). I guess it should also reprise some points made at https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/323.

Ideally these would be using prof-o, on the condition that we still refer to prof-o as a suggestion not a formal recommendation (see the way it's been mentioned above).
