    <h1>Introduction (non-normative)</h1>
	<div class="note">(Antoine:) I feel Nick's intro can be re-worked/completed (for example mentioning <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/">DWBP</a>). But for now I'm keeping it, as I think it is correct and works well as introductory material
	</div>
 <p>
		A profile is generally understood as representing a point of view. In information technology, profiles may also support the data needs of specific applications. Profiling is often the work of a community interested in interoperability and data exchange. We define a profile generally as named set of constraints on one or more identified base specifications.</p>

<p>		Communities create and use data standards to ensure interoperability for information exchange. Although members of a community may use the same basic standard schema, it is very common for different subsets within the larger community to need some further specification of the data they create to meet their own needs. To continue to support interoperability of their data with others, these community members need to express the specifics of their implementation of the data schema. Profiles serve this purpose. Profiles enumerate vocabulary terms, cardinality, and validation rules, and can also include descriptions of the rules used by creators to make decisions regarding their data elements.</p>

<p>		Good metadata practice begins with the builders of vocabularies and ontologies. Builders of vocabularies and ontologies are encouraged to make their work as broadly applicable as possible so as to maximize future adoption. As a result, vocabularies and ontologies typically define a data model using minimal semantics. For example, DCAT [vocab-dcat-2] defines the concept of a dataset as an abstract entity with distributions and data services as means of accessing data. It is silent on whether a distribution should be in a particular serialization, or set of serializations. It is also silent on how data services should be configured. While it states that the value of dcat:theme should be a SKOS concept, it does not specify a particular SKOS [skos-reference] concept scheme, and so on. Other vocabularies such as Dublin Core Terms [DCTERMS] are equally parsimonious in their prescriptions of how they should be used. This means that data models and methods of working can be applied in different circumstances than those in which the original definition work was carried out and, in that sense, these promote broad interoperability.</p>

<p>		In addition to addressing the needs of a specific community, a profile may also apply to a single system. Any individual system will be designed to meet a specific set of needs; that is, it will operate in a specific context. It is that context, and the individual choices made by the engineers working within it, that will determine how a vocabulary or set of vocabularies will be used. For example, a system ingesting data may require that a specific subset of properties from a range of vocabularies is used and that only terms from a defined code list are used as values for specified properties. In other words, where the 'base vocabulary' might say "the value of this property SHOULD be a value from a managed code list", a specialized profile will say "the value of this property MUST be from this specific code list".</p>
<p>
		This document is about how to formulate and communicate profiles.</p>
    
    <div class="note">(Antoine:) Nick suggested to reuse some elements of the F2F3 outline as a 'motivation' section. I believe the following ones could be mentioned in intro:
		<ul>
			<li>Communities, national identity on data standards, domains of activity</li>
			<li>Functions: consensus; sharing; search; etc.</li>
    </ul>
	</div>
	  
    <h4>Related work and examples of existing profiles</h4>
    <p>
      <em>profiling</em> is an activity that has been undertaken by many communities with a range of formalisms.

      (Antoine:) These examples were recommended in another part in https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/242#issuecomment-408916364. 
	    We now try to have them mentioned in the intro and in the section to present examples of applying best practices. 
	    Karen's note below could provide the rationale for mentioning examples here.
    </div>
    <div class="note">
      (Karen:) I had thought of this as showing examples of TYPES of profiles. There are profiles like DCAT that take place within a community, make primary use of a base metadata schema, but add or remove based on local need. There are profiles like ODRL that have a very formal meaning (legal license) and are in essence cumulative, with the base standard elements assumed and specific rules for over-riding. There are profiles that use only the namespace of the base profile, but are defined subsets (BIBFRA.ME, but any other example of this would be fine - that's the one I know). And then we could perhaps find a profile that has no strong base profile (ADMS perhaps?) but combines elements as needed from a variety of sources and is independent of any existing vocabulary. The idea would be to show a range of profile motivations, designs, and community involvement.

    <h2>What is a profile? (normative)</h2>
    <div class="note">(Antoine:) From https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/242#issuecomment-408916364:
		<ul>
			<li>A profile SHOULD have a textual description intended for humans</li>
			<li>A profile SHOULD describe metadata elements/properties</li>
			<li>A profile SHOULD describe valid value types for elements</li>
			<li>A profile SHOULD provide relevant cardinality rules</li>
			<li>(etc. here until we finalize requirements - these are just examples)</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="note">(Antoine:) Though it should likely be formatted differently, I see this section as reprising Nick's idea in sections 5.2 and 5.3 at
https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/blob/a7403b8c3ceb2630a1a1eb87da7b9babc6fd2d7e/profiles/index.html (i.e. <a href="https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/profiles/#description">here</a> and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/profiles/#functions">here</a> in the version of 15 Sept 2018). I.e. list some of the DXWG requirements on profile and explain how they translate in recommendations, when needed.</div>
    
    <div class="note">(Antoine:) At this stage I have doubts on whether all requirements should be reflected in this section. Perhaps we should have only two clusters for the requirements about administrative and descriptive metadata in this section and detail them later, in the section about that metadata.</div>

    </div>
    <div class="issue" data-number="365" title="URI Requirements">
      (Antoine:) I think the URI requirements fits here. In fact I think this section should be the one that acts as a 'cover/teaser' for our conneg doc. I.e. it gives a brief motivation for it, tries to fit it in our general picture/model and point to it as our recommendation
    </div>
    <div class="note">
      (Antoine:) To make this section work, I think it will be good if the reader can see our 'big picture' on profiles and their possible (or recommended) components. I'm thinking of something at the level of the diagram at https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1dHkpwKwUwMgS1RqSCTPO3uOoRiY_qNk0z5bhXJlYi4Y/, which should work as an abstracted version of the ProfileDesc model https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/profiledesc/profiledesc.png (i.e. one without classes and properties that come from a specific namespace/vocabulary. NB: at this stage I'm not sure if this diagram would fit better in this section or in the one above ('What is a profile?').

  <section id="metadata">
    <h2>Administrative and descriptive metadata (normative)</h2>
    <div class="note">(Antoine:) From https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/242#issuecomment-408916364, Administrative metadata:

			<li>A profile MUST have URI (or an IRI?) identifying it. The URI SHOULD be an http URI</li>

			<li>etc</li>
			<li></li>

   <div class="note">(Antoine:) I've kept it here, but I do agree with the comment at  https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/242#issuecomment-408916364 (and above) that URI should be in a specific section on publication of profiles.</div>
    <div class="note">(Antoine:) From https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/242#issuecomment-408916364, Descriptive metadata:

    <div class="issue" data-number="369" title="Human-readable description location">
      (Antoine:) One may argue that human-readable description (if it's provided as a full document) does fit better in a separate section. But upon re-reading the structure suggested by Karen I was not sure of the 'granularity' (of the description) meant here.
    </div>
    <div class="note">(Antoine:) In this section we could list all the requirements on metadata, which we have not listed in the 'What is a profile?' section.</div>

  <section id="ProfileDesc">
    <h2>The ProfileDesc vocabulary (non-normative)</h2>
    <div class="note">
      (Antoine:) What I have in mind for this section is to introduce the DXWG ProfileDesc RDF vocabulary. Say how it can support the requirements we identified, point to it, and suggest to use in contexts where an RDF / Linked Data description of the profiles and their associated resources can be made. If it's non-normative, it should be presented as a possible approach to implementing our recommendations, for example using a sentence like <i>The machine-readable version of the metadata on profiles and their links to associated resources may be provided using the ProfileDesc Vocabulary developed by the DXWG working group</i> (shamelessly inspired from how we've done it in the DWBP doc at https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#quality). I guess it should also reprise some points made at https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/323.
    </div>

  <section id="examples">
    <h2>Examples of applying these recommendations (non-normative)</h2>
    <div class="note">(Antoine:) The idea here would be to point to examples that follow our recommendations, made up to illustrate specific features, or complete 'real' implementations. Ideally these would be using ProfileDesc, on the condition that we still refer to ProfileDesc as a suggestion not a formal recommendation (see the way it's been mentioned above). I reckon that some may find it more natural to have fully fledged</div>
    <div class="issue" data-number="370" title="ProfileDesc example">
      (Antoine:) Some may prefer to have fully fledged examples in ProfileDesc in ProfileDesc's own documentation. I do think there is value in having at least some examples here, even if as a result we decide that the ProfileDesc documentation would be a 'pure' namespace doc like this one for SKOS: https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html
