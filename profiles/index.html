    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <p>
			A <em>profile</em> can be understood as an outline of some "thing" when seen from a specific point of view. 
			Also, <em>Profiling</em> is the task of distilling the essential aspects or character of something, such as a person, 
			from a specific angle. In the craft domain, a profile is taken by a tool that matches itself in detail 
			to the contours of a 3-dimensional object and returns a 2-dimensional accurate representation from which other 
			formable materials can be constrained and fashioned to that profile, or matched with it to determine how accurately 
			it portrays the original 3-dimensional object from which the profile was taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same sense then, information entities can be viewed from different perspectives and in order to prepare 
			them for specific uses they are frequently tested for their goodness of fit to some pattern, or the pattern 
			can be provided prior to the gathering of the information to provide some constraint to ensure adequacy and 
			appropriateness of that information asset to the job in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In information technology, profiles may also
      support the data needs of specific applications. Profiling is often the work of a community interested in
      interoperability and data exchange. We define a profile generally as named set of constraints on one or more
      identified base specifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good data practice generally begins with vocabulary and ontology designers who
      are encouraged to make their work as broadly applicable as possible so as to maximize future adoption.
      As a result, vocabularies and ontologies typically define a data model using minimal semantics. For example,
      DCAT [[vocab-dcat-2]] defines the concept of a dataset as an abstract entity with distributions and data services
      as means of accessing data; there is no mention of whether a distribution should be in a particular serialization, or
      set of serializations, nor of how data services should be configured. While it states that the
      value of dcat:theme should be a SKOS [[skos-reference]] concept, it does not specify a particular SKOS concept
      scheme, and so on. Other vocabularies, such as Dublin Core Terms [[DCTERMS]], are similarly for general use. 
	  This means that data models and methods of working can be applied in
      different circumstances than those in which the original definition work was carried out and, in that sense,
      these promote broad interoperability.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to addressing the needs of a specific community, a profile may also apply to a single system. Any
      individual system will be designed to meet a specific set of needs; that is, it will operate in a specific
      context. It is that context, and the individual choices made by the engineers working within it, that will
      determine how a vocabulary or set of vocabularies will be used. For example, a system ingesting data may require
      that a specific subset of properties from a range of vocabularies is used and that only terms from a defined code
      list are used as values for specified properties. In other words, where the 'base vocabulary' might say "the
      value of this property SHOULD be a value from a managed code list", a specialized profile will say "the value of
      this property MUST be from this specific code list".
    </p>
    <p>
      This document is about how to formulate and communicate profiles and the ways in which profiles can be 
		identified and related to each other.

    <section id="definitions">
      <h3>Definitions</h3>
    <p>
			We recognise that the term 'profile' occurs in several domains, and that there are a range of definitions 
			available from different communities. We have taken this variability into account but for the purpose of this document we 
			are using the following definition:
    <p>
      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>profile</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            A named set of constraints on one or more identified base <em>specifications</em>,
            including the identification of any implementing subclasses of datatypes,
            semantic interpretations, vocabularies, options and parameters of those base specifications
            necessary to accomplish a particular function.
          </p>
          <p>
            This definition includes what are often called "application profiles", "metadata application
            profiles", or "metadata profiles".

    <section id="motivation">
      <h3>The motivation for profiles</h3>
     <p>
      Communities create and use data standards to ensure interoperability for information exchange. Although members
      of a community may use the same basic standard schema, it is very common for different subsets within the larger
      community to need some further specification of the data they create to meet their own needs. To continue to
      support interoperability of their data with others, these community members need to express the specifics of
      their implementation of the data schema. Profiles serve this purpose. Profiles enumerate vocabulary terms,
      cardinality, and validation rules, and can also include descriptions of the rules used by creators to make
      decisions regarding their data elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/">DXWG use case and requirements document</a> [[DCAT-UCR]], our group 
      has identified typical use cases for profiles, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/ucr/#ID7">associating fine-grained semantics for datasets and resources within a dataset</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/ucr/#ID41">expression of vocabulary constraints</a>, and</li>
      <li><a href="https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/ucr/#ID46">support for input functions</a></li>

      <h3>Examples of profiles and related work</h3>
			<p>
        Profiles can take a number of forms and can have a variety of relationships to existing vocabularies, 
				standards, and other profiles. We recognise this variety, but for the purposes of this document we are focusing 
				on the most general forms of profiles and profiling. Although it is not possible to list all of the types 
				of profiles, some illustrations of frequently-used profiles include:
      </p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>profiles that are subsets of a larger vocabulary</strong>. These reduce the vocabulary terms of a broad data 
					standard to a smaller number of terms that are useful for a particular community member or application. 
					An example of this is <a href="http://bibfra.me/">BIBFRA.me</a>, which is designed for library materials and defines 
					both a core set of terms as well as profiles for specialized communities such as cataloging of rare materials 
					or early printing trade. In this community, all profiles use only terms from a single vocabulary.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>profiles that can both reduce and extend a base standard</strong>. These profiles are developed by members of a 
					data-sharing community but for reasons of jurisdiction or specialization need to add terms beyond the base 
					standard vocabulary in order to meet their needs. They may also omit terms from the base standard that are not 
					relevant to their implementations. An example of this is data catalog vocabulary standard, DCAT, its primary 
					profile, DCAT-AP, and the national variants (DCAT-AT-IT, DCAT-AP-NO, DCAT-AT-DE). While maintaining overall 
					compatibility with the larger data catalog community, each of these profiles adds needed terms for the local 
					variant. These profiles generally make use of terms from more than one namespace.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>profiles that amend a base standard by inheriting or overriding values of that standard</strong>. The example here 
					is of the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) which is a language to support rights in the use of digital 
					content in publishing, distribution, and consumption of digital media. The ODRL language encodes a policy 
					that has a core vocabulary that can be extended or overridden by individual instances called "profiles."
					<div class="issue" data-number="368"></div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>profiles that use some vocabulary terms from multiple standards without having a strong relationship to any 
					base standard</strong>. These profiles develop new groupings of existing terms as vocabularies and may define new 
					terms as needed. An example of this is the Asset Description Metadata Schema (ADMS) vocabulary [[vocab-adms]]
				</li>

      <h2>Diving into profiles</h2>
      <p>This section builds on the formal definition for <a>profile</a> as well as the requirements the W3C Data Exchange Working Group (DXWG) has identified, and lays down a conceptual model for profiles, their components 
        and their functions.
    </p>
    <p>Its goal is to establish a general view of profiles that supports the many potentially more specific examples 
      in practice. Usages of the term 'profile' in other contexts may not be consistent with these requirements, 
      and are thus out of scope.
    </p>
      <p>A Profile is based on an existing Specification, which can have the status of a Standard and which can itself be 
        a Profile of another Specification. A profile can have various Components/Manifestations in various expression languages for profiles.
        These Components/Manifestations play specific Functions (roles) for the implementation of the services that motivate the creation of the Profile. 
        These Components are serialized and published as Distributions in various formats, which are the concrete input for performing these services.
        </p>
    
   <div class="note">
    <p>
      The idea of the previous paragraph is to have a set of links to various sections, as done in the SKOS Primer at 
	    https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/#secsimple. 
	    It needs to be re-written considering the final structure of the document. 
	    Also, the terminology in this section is still under discussion, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/747">here</a> or 
      <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/795">here</a>.
    </p>
  </div>
    
    <p>The profile may be expressed in a single specification, or it may consist of more than one component. 
      For example, a profile may have a vocabulary in the form of a schema (such as OWL or XML schema), as 
      well as a text file containing documentation for persons doing data creation, and actionable validation code, 
      such as a ShEx or SHACL document. Components may be added or removed without changing the fact that the profile 
      meets the definition of a profile as stated in this document. A profile can exist independently of the set of 
      resources that is used to describe it.

    <p>
	    When building a profile you SHOULD give it a name and you SHOULD build it from properties or terms that 
	    you have collected from pre-existing sources. Because we are considering a wide range of profiles, 
	    not just those in RDF, collections could be of metadata terms from any type of metadata schema, but 
      they might also include collections of identifiers, value lists and enumerations, other data elements,

      and your community

    <p>One can create a profile of profiles, where conforming to a lower profile in the hierarchy means conforming

    <p>This guidance document leaves open, which level profile creators should indicate as their base.

	  	    Because profiles are intended to convey information both within a community and at times between communities, wide use would be facilitated by BP13, which is that the profile should use locale-neutral data representations where possible. Some data communities have deep and historical practices that use terminology that is specific to the community. The creation of a profile is an opportunity to transform that practice to widely known standards.

  	  	    BP15 is one of the cornerstones of the profile practice, which is to reuse vocabularies, in particular standardized ones.

  	<p class="practicedesc">
  	    The recommendation in BP16 is to choose the right formalization level. This is a useful recommendation for all data and metadata, and would naturally apply to profiles. Profiles should be suited to the tasks they are designed to support; not less nor more. In particular we should caution against overly strict use of constraints, which then make it harder for others to either make direct use of the profile or to create a profile of the profile where their needs vary only a small amount.

        SHACL files, etc). This includes listing of elements in the profile, instructions and recommendations
        on how to use them, constraints that determine what data is valid according to the profile, etc.</p>

  	<p>
  		<span id="bp9" class="practicelab">BP9 Use persistent URIs as identifiers of datasets</span>
  	</p>
  	<p class="practicedesc">
  	    Use persistent URIs as identifiers of profiles. This seems to be a non-controversial requirement because it applies to any web resource. There is a related best practice (BP10) which is stated as "Use persistent URIs as identifiers within datasets." This can be well-suited to the aspect of a profile that consists of the reuse of vocabulary terms that have been prevously defined, but also to the definition of new terms within the scope of the profile itself. Each element of a profile's vocabulary should have a URI (IRI?) that identifies the term and information about the term (such as labels, definitions, etc.)       
  	  </p>
  	</div>
  <div class="practice">	
  	<p>
  		<span id="bp14" class="practicelab">BP14 Provide data in multiple formats</span>
  	</p>
  	<p class="practicedesc">
  	    The BPs also recommend that data be provided in multiple formats, and this is a good recommendation for profiles as well. If we take the point of view that profiles, like DCAT, have an abstract essence that can be made manifest in more than one way, we already have a good basis for satisfaction of BP14. (This will bring up the question that has already come up in the context of DCAT and conneg - are all of the forms equivalent? We may not be able to resolve that question.)       
  	  </p>
  	</div>
  <div class="practice">	
  	<p>
  		<span id="bp12" class="practicelab">	BP12 Use machine-readable standardized data formats</span>
  	</p>
  	<p class="practicedesc">
  	   profiles should be published in standard data formats (BP12). It should also be stated that profiles should be published in and make use of technologies that are appropriate to the community which is expected to use them. A profile using RDF and OWL will not well serve a community that has only an XML/XSD-based skill set. This also relates to the above recommendation relating to providing data in multiple formats. In many communities the skills and data history can vary, so providing profiles with as many as possible of the commonly used technologies will increase the utility of the profile (as well as the profiled instance data).

  	<p>
  		<span id="bp1" class="practicelab">BP1 Provide metadata</span>
  	</p>
  	<p class="practicedesc">
In the BPoW this is defined as metadata about the dataset; with profiles this can be descriptive metadata within the profile or a separate metadata statement about the profile. (Since profiles themselves are generally forms of metadata they may be able to incorporate description and other administrative information about the profile within itself, if desired.) In addition there is a common set of administrative data that is recommended for many information resources such as dates and version designators for each version, and provenance (who or what agency created the digital file).

	  		<span id="bp12" class="practicelab">BP 2: Provide descriptive metadata</span>
	  	</p>
	  	<p class="practicedesc">
	The BPDoW limits its recommendation of metadata covering the topic of the dataset to general keywords and themes and categories (BP2). It may be desirable provide more specific topical information to satisfy the DXWG requirement that profiles should be discoverable by search engines. The quality of discoverability will vary based on the depth of description of the topic and/or community area that it serves. (We may wish to recommend some particulars.)

		  		<span id="bp30" class="practicelab">BP30 Make feedback available</span>
		  	</p>
		  	<p class="practicedesc">
Ideally, the profile would have a management cycle for maintenance and updates. This should involve the community of users, as noted in BP29 (Gather feedback from data consumers) and BP30 (make feedback available). The strength and value of a profile will depend on the involvement of the community of users.

			The aspect of the management cycle that is often ignored is that of the de-commissioning of datasets or of superseded versions. For users it is key that previously used identifiers always point to a useful document or message.

    <h2>The Profiles ontology</h2>

    <div class="note">
      (Antoine:) What I have in mind for this section is to introduce the DXWG Profiles ontology. Say how it can support the requirements we identified, point to it, and suggest to use in contexts where an RDF / Linked Data description of the profiles and their associated resources can be made. If it's non-normative, it should be presented as a possible approach to implementing our recommendations, for example using a sentence like <i>The machine-readable version of the metadata on profiles and their links to associated resources may be provided using the Profiles ontology developed by the DXWG working group</i> (shamelessly inspired from how we've done it in the DWBP doc at https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#quality). I guess it should also reprise some points made at https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/323.
