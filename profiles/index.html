<section id="introduction">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
  <p>
    A <em>profile</em> can be understood as an outline of some "thing" when seen from a specific point of view.
    Also, <em>Profiling</em> is the task of distilling the essential aspects or character of something, such as a
    person,
    from a specific angle. In the craft domain, a profile is taken by a tool that matches itself in detail
    to the contours of a 3-dimensional object and returns a 2-dimensional accurate representation from which other
    formable materials can be constrained and fashioned to that profile, or matched with it to determine how accurately
    it portrays the original 3-dimensional object from which the profile was taken.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the same sense then, information entities can be viewed from different perspectives and in order to prepare
    them for specific uses they are frequently tested for their goodness of fit to some pattern, or the pattern
    can be provided prior to the gathering of the information to provide some constraint to ensure adequacy and
    appropriateness of that information asset to the job in hand.
  </p>
  <p>
    In information technology, profiles may also
    support the data needs of specific applications. Profiling is often the work of a community interested in
    interoperability and data exchange. We define a profile generally as named set of constraints on one or more
    identified base specifications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Good data practice generally begins with vocabulary and ontology designers who
    are encouraged to make their work as broadly applicable as possible so as to maximize future adoption.
    As a result, vocabularies and ontologies typically define a data model using minimal semantics. For example,
    DCAT [[vocab-dcat-2]] defines the concept of a dataset as an abstract entity with distributions and data services
    as means of accessing data; there is no mention of whether a distribution should be in a particular serialization,
    or
    set of serializations, nor of how data services should be configured. While it states that the
    value of dcat:theme should be a SKOS [[skos-reference]] concept, it does not specify a particular SKOS concept
    scheme, and so on. Other vocabularies, such as Dublin Core Terms [[DCTERMS]], are similarly for general use.
    This means that data models and methods of working can be applied in
    different circumstances than those in which the original definition work was carried out and, in that sense,
    these promote broad interoperability.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to addressing the needs of a specific community, a profile may also apply to a single system. Any
    individual system will be designed to meet a specific set of needs; that is, it will operate in a specific
    context. It is that context, and the individual choices made by the engineers working within it, that will
    determine how a vocabulary or set of vocabularies will be used. For example, a system ingesting data may require
    that a specific subset of properties from a range of vocabularies is used and that only terms from a defined code
    list are used as values for specified properties. In other words, where the 'base vocabulary' might say "the
    value of this property SHOULD be a value from a managed code list", a specialized profile will say "the value of
    this property MUST be from this specific code list".
  </p>
  <p>
    This document is about how to formulate and communicate profiles and the ways in which profiles can be
    identified and related to each other.

  <section id="definitions">
    <h3>Definitions</h3>
    <p>
      We recognise that the term 'profile' occurs in multiple domains and that there are a range of definitions
      available from different communities. Within this document we concentrate on data profiles as a special case of
      profiles and use the following definition that and related terms that consistent across the DXWG's profiles
      documents:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><dfn data-lt="profile">data profile</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          A data specification that constrains, extends, combines, or provides guidance or explanation about the usage of other data specifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          A data profile may also be known as an <em>application profile</em> or perhaps just a <em>profile</em> and in this document is referred to as just "profile".
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn data-lt="specification">data specification</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        A specification, with human- and/or machine-processable representations, that defines the content and structure of data used in a given context.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <div class="issue" data-number="448"></div>
  </section>

  <section id="motivation">
    <h3>The motivation for profiles</h3>
    <p>
      Communities create and use data standards to ensure interoperability for information exchange. Although members
      of a community may use the same basic standard schema, it is very common for different subsets within the larger
      community to need some further specification of the data they create to meet their own needs. To continue to
      support interoperability of their data with others, these community members need to express the specifics of
      their implementation of the data schema. Profiles serve this purpose. Profiles enumerate vocabulary terms,
      cardinality, and validation rules, and can also include descriptions of the rules used by creators to make
      decisions regarding their data elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/">DXWG use case and requirements document</a> [[DCAT-UCR]], our
      group
      has identified typical use cases for profiles, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/ucr/#ID7">associating fine-grained semantics for datasets and resources
        within a dataset</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/ucr/#ID41">expression of vocabulary constraints</a>, and</li>
      <li><a href="https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/ucr/#ID46">support for input functions</a></li>
    </ul>

  <section id="examplesrelatedwork">
    <h3>Examples of profiles and related work</h3>
    <p>
      Profiles can take a number of forms and can have a variety of relationships to existing vocabularies,
      standards, and other profiles. We recognise this variety, but for the purposes of this document we are focusing
      on the most general forms of profiles and profiling. Although it is not possible to list all of the types
      of profiles, some illustrations of frequently-used profiles include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>profiles that are subsets of a larger vocabulary</strong>. These reduce the vocabulary terms of a broad
        data
        standard to a smaller number of terms that are useful for a particular community member or application.
        An example of this is <a href="http://bibfra.me/">BIBFRA.me</a>, which is designed for library materials and
        defines
        both a core set of terms as well as profiles for specialized communities such as cataloging of rare materials
        or early printing trade. In this community, all profiles use only terms from a single vocabulary.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>profiles that can both reduce and extend a base standard</strong>. These profiles are developed by
        members of a
        data-sharing community but for reasons of jurisdiction or specialization need to add terms beyond the base
        standard vocabulary in order to meet their needs. They may also omit terms from the base standard that are not
        relevant to their implementations. An example of this is data catalog vocabulary standard, DCAT, its primary
        profile, DCAT-AP, and the national variants (DCAT-AT-IT, DCAT-AP-NO, DCAT-AT-DE). While maintaining overall
        compatibility with the larger data catalog community, each of these profiles adds needed terms for the local
        variant. These profiles generally make use of terms from more than one namespace.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>profiles that amend a base standard by inheriting or overriding values of that standard</strong>. The
        example here
        is of the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) which is a language to support rights in the use of digital
        content in publishing, distribution, and consumption of digital media. The ODRL language encodes a policy
        that has a core vocabulary that can be extended or overridden by individual instances called "profiles."
        <div class="issue" data-number="368"></div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>profiles that use some vocabulary terms from multiple standards without having a strong relationship to
          any
          base standard</strong>. These profiles develop new groupings of existing terms as vocabularies and may define
        new
        terms as needed. An example of this is the Asset Description Metadata Schema (ADMS) vocabulary [[vocab-adms]]

  <h2>Diving into profiles</h2>
  <p>
    This section builds on the formal definition for <a>profile</a> as well as the requirements the W3C Data Exchange
    Working Group (DXWG) has identified, and lays down a conceptual model for profiles, their components and their
    functions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Its goal is to establish a general view of profiles that supports the many potentially more specific examples
    in practice. Usages of the term 'profile' in other contexts may not be consistent with these requirements,
    and are thus out of scope.
  </p>
  <p>
    A <a>profile</a> is based on an existing <a>specification</a>, which can have the status of a standard and which can itself be
    a profile of another specification. A profile can have various components/manifestations in various expression
    languages for profiles. These components/manifestations play specific functions (roles) for the implementation of
    the services that motivate the creation of the profile. These components are serialized and published as
    distributions in various formats, which are the concrete input for performing these services.
  </p>
  <div class="note">
    The idea of the previous paragraph is to have a set of links to various sections, as done in the SKOS Primer at
    https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/#secsimple. It needs to be re-written considering the final structure of the
    document. Also, the terminology in this section is still under discussion, e.g.
    <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/747">here</a> or
    <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/795">here</a>.
  </div>
  <p>
    A profile may be expressed in a single specification, or it may consist of more than one component.
    For example, a profile may have a vocabulary in the form of a schema (such as OWL or XML schema), as
    well as a text file containing documentation for persons doing data creation, and actionable validation code,
    such as a ShEx or SHACL document. Components may be added or removed without changing the fact that the profile
    meets the definition of a profile as stated in this document. A profile can exist independently of the set of
    resources that is used to describe it.

    <h3>Profiles are uniquely named sets of data constraints, such as data elements (e.g. classes, properties, value
      domains) that describe (meta)data.</h3>
    <!--<h3>Named collections of terms [RPFNCTERMS]</h3>-->
    <p>
      When building a profile you SHOULD give it a name and you SHOULD build it from properties or terms that
      you have collected from pre-existing sources. Because we are considering a wide range of profiles,
      not just those in RDF, collections could be of metadata terms from any type of metadata schema, but
      they might also include collections of identifiers, value lists and enumerations, other data elements,
      and anything else that might be helpful in ensuring that the data matches the purpose intended by you
      and your community

    <h3>Multiple base specifications [RPFMBSPEC]</h3>
    <p>
      A profile MAY be based on multiple base specifications. For example, a profile MAY be based on several data models
      and vocabularies at the same time. In profiles using XML schema or RDF technology, using multiple base
      specifications generally means using elements from multiple namespaces. A profile can constrain all or some
      elements from its base specifications.

    <h3>Profile of profiles [RPFPP]</h3>
    <p>
      One can create a profile of profiles, where conforming to a lower profile in the hierarchy means conforming
      to all the above profiles. For example (see figure), conforming to the DPLA Metadata Application Profile
      means conforming to the Europeana Data Model, Dublin Core terms and Open Archives Initiative Object Reuse and
      Exchange.

      This example may be updated in the future, so as to reflect the decision on

      This guidance document leaves open, which level profile creators should indicate as their base.
      Indeed, the granularity of the work of profile creators vary: some may profile an existing profile as a
      'ready-made', others may dive into the details of each original specification. In any case, the mechanism
      that we recommend for describing profiles allows data consumers to "follow their nose" through arbitrary

        Because profiles are intended to convey information both within a community and at times between communities,
        wide use would be facilitated by BP13, which is that the profile should use locale-neutral data representations
        where possible. Some data communities have deep and historical practices that use terminology that is specific
        to the community. The creation of a profile is an opportunity to transform that practice to widely known
        standards.

        BP15 is one of the cornerstones of the profile practice, which is to reuse vocabularies, in particular
        standardized ones. One would need to define "standardized" in this context, but perhaps a better solution is to
        define the qualities of preferred vocabularies: have a stable URI; are supported by an organization or

        The recommendation in BP16 is to choose the right formalization level. This is a useful recommendation for all
        data and metadata, and would naturally apply to profiles. Profiles should be suited to the tasks they are
        designed to support; not less nor more. In particular we should caution against overly strict use of
        constraints, which then make it harder for others to either make direct use of the profile or to create a
        profile of the profile where their needs vary only a small amount.

      A profile should have human-readable documentation that expresses for humans the main components

      SHACL files, etc). This includes listing of elements in the profile, instructions and recommendations
      on how to use them, constraints that determine what data is valid according to the profile, etc.

      </p>
      <p class="practicedesc">
        Use persistent URIs as identifiers of profiles. This seems to be a non-controversial requirement because it
        applies to any web resource. There is a related best practice (BP10) which is stated as "Use persistent URIs as
        identifiers within datasets." This can be well-suited to the aspect of a profile that consists of the reuse of
        vocabulary terms that have been prevously defined, but also to the definition of new terms within the scope of
        the profile itself. Each element of a profile's vocabulary should have a URI (IRI?) that identifies the term and
        information about the term (such as labels, definitions, etc.)
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="practice">

        <span id="bp14" class="practicelab">BP14 Provide data in multiple formats</span>
      </p>
      <p class="practicedesc">
        The BPs also recommend that data be provided in multiple formats, and this is a good recommendation for profiles
        as well. If we take the point of view that profiles, like DCAT, have an abstract essence that can be made
        manifest in more than one way, we already have a good basis for satisfaction of BP14. (This will bring up the
        question that has already come up in the context of DCAT and conneg - are all of the forms equivalent? We may
        not be able to resolve that question.)

        <span id="bp12" class="practicelab">	BP12 Use machine-readable standardized data formats</span>
      </p>
      <p class="practicedesc">
        profiles should be published in standard data formats (BP12). It should also be stated that profiles should be
        published in and make use of technologies that are appropriate to the community which is expected to use them. A
        profile using RDF and OWL will not well serve a community that has only an XML/XSD-based skill set. This also
        relates to the above recommendation relating to providing data in multiple formats. In many communities the
        skills and data history can vary, so providing profiles with as many as possible of the commonly used
        technologies will increase the utility of the profile (as well as the profiled instance data).

      <p class="practicedesc">
        In the BPoW this is defined as metadata about the dataset; with profiles this can be descriptive metadata within
        the profile or a separate metadata statement about the profile. (Since profiles themselves are generally forms
        of metadata they may be able to incorporate description and other administrative information about the profile
        within itself, if desired.) In addition there is a common set of administrative data that is recommended for
        many information resources such as dates and version designators for each version, and provenance (who or what
        agency created the digital file).

      <p class="practicedesc">
        The BPDoW limits its recommendation of metadata covering the topic of the dataset to general keywords and themes
        and categories (BP2). It may be desirable provide more specific topical information to satisfy the DXWG
        requirement that profiles should be discoverable by search engines. The quality of discoverability will vary
        based on the depth of description of the topic and/or community area that it serves. (We may wish to recommend
        some particulars.)

      </p>
      <p class="practicedesc">
        Ideally, the profile would have a management cycle for maintenance and updates. This should involve the
        community of users, as noted in BP29 (Gather feedback from data consumers) and BP30 (make feedback available).
        The strength and value of a profile will depend on the involvement of the community of users.

      <p class="practicedesc">
        The aspect of the management cycle that is often ignored is that of the de-commissioning of datasets or of
        superseded versions. For users it is key that previously used identifiers always point to a useful document or
        message.

    (Antoine:) What I have in mind for this section is to introduce the DXWG Profiles ontology. Say how it can support
    the requirements we identified, point to it, and suggest to use in contexts where an RDF / Linked Data description
    of the profiles and their associated resources can be made. If it's non-normative, it should be presented as a
    possible approach to implementing our recommendations, for example using a sentence like <i>The machine-readable
    version of the metadata on profiles and their links to associated resources may be provided using the Profiles
    ontology developed by the DXWG working group</i> (shamelessly inspired from how we've done it in the DWBP doc at
    https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#quality). I guess it should also reprise some points made at
