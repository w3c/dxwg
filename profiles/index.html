    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <p>
      A profile is generally understood as representing a point of view. In information technology, profiles may also
      support the data needs of specific applications. Profiling is often the work of a community interested in
      interoperability and data exchange. We define a profile generally as named set of constraints on one or more
      identified base specifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Communities create and use data standards to ensure interoperability for information exchange. Although members
      of a community may use the same basic standard schema, it is very common for different subsets within the larger
      community to need some further specification of the data they create to meet their own needs. To continue to
      support interoperability of their data with others, these community members need to express the specifics of
      their implementation of the data schema. Profiles serve this purpose. Profiles enumerate vocabulary terms,
      cardinality, and validation rules, and can also include descriptions of the rules used by creators to make
      decisions regarding their data elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good metadata practice begins with the builders of vocabularies and ontologies. Builders of vocabularies and
      ontologies are encouraged to make their work as broadly applicable as possible so as to maximize future adoption.
      As a result, vocabularies and ontologies typically define a data model using minimal semantics. For example,
      DCAT [[vocab-dcat-2]] defines the concept of a dataset as an abstract entity with distributions and data services
      as means of accessing data; it is silent on whether a distribution should be in a particular serialization, or
      set of serializations. It is also silent on how data services should be configured. While it states that the
      value of dcat:theme should be a SKOS [[skos-reference]] concept, it does not specify a particular SKOS concept
      scheme, and so on. Other vocabularies, such as Dublin Core Terms [[DCTERMS]], are equally parsimonious in their
      prescriptions of how they should be used. This means that data models and methods of working can be applied in
      different circumstances than those in which the original definition work was carried out and, in that sense,
      these promote broad interoperability.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to addressing the needs of a specific community, a profile may also apply to a single system. Any
      individual system will be designed to meet a specific set of needs; that is, it will operate in a specific
      context. It is that context, and the individual choices made by the engineers working within it, that will
      determine how a vocabulary or set of vocabularies will be used. For example, a system ingesting data may require
      that a specific subset of properties from a range of vocabularies is used and that only terms from a defined code
      list are used as values for specified properties. In other words, where the 'base vocabulary' might say "the
      value of this property SHOULD be a value from a managed code list", a specialized profile will say "the value of
      this property MUST be from this specific code list".
    </p>

      This document is about how to formulate and communicate profiles.

      <h3>Types of profiles and related work</h3>
        <div class="note"><p>
      (Antoine:) The idea is that this section will contain text the define the types of profiles and their motivation in general terms, 
          as well as pointing to examples, as done at <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/435#issuecomment-426928897">in this draft</a>. As Karen said:</p>
          <p>(Karen:) I had thought of this as showing examples of TYPES of profiles. There are profiles like DCAT that take place 
            within a community, make primary use of a base metadata schema, but add or remove based on local need. There are profiles 
            like ODRL that have a very formal meaning (legal license) and are in essence cumulative, with the base standard elements 
            assumed and specific rules for over-riding. There are profiles that use only the namespace of the base profile, but are 
            defined subsets (BIBFRA.ME, but any other example of this would be fine - that's the one I know). And then we could perhaps 
            find a profile that has no strong base profile (ADMS perhaps?) but combines elements as needed from a variety of sources and 
            is independent of any existing vocabulary. The idea would be to show a range of profile motivations, designs, and community 
            involvement.</p>

      <h2>Profiles defined</h2>
      <p>This section builds on the formal definition for <a>profile</a> and the requirements DXWG has identified, and lays down a conceptual model for profiles, their components 
        and their functions.</p>
      <p>A Profile is based on an existing Specification, which can have the status of a Standard and which can be itself 
        a Profile of another Specification. A profile can have various Components/Manifestations in various expression languages for profiles.
        These Components/Manifestations play specific Functions (roles) for the implementation of the services that motivate the creation of the Profile. 
        These Components are serialized and published as Distributions in various formats, which are the concrete input for performing these services.

	  	    Because profiles are intended to convey information both within a community and at times between communities, wide use would be facilitated by BP13, which is that the profile should use locale-neutral data representations where possible. Some data communities have deep and historical practices that use terminology that is specific to the community. The creation of a profile is an opportunity to transform that practice to widely known standards.

  	  	    BP15 is one of the cornerstones of the profile practice, which is to reuse vocabularies, in particular standardized ones.

  	<p class="practicedesc">
  	    Use persistent URIs as identifiers of profiles. This seems to be a non-controversial requirement because it applies to any web resource. There is a related best practice (BP10) which is stated as "Use persistent URIs as identifiers within datasets." This can be well-suited to the aspect of a profile that consists of the reuse of vocabulary terms that have been prevously defined, but also to the definition of new terms within the scope of the profile itself. Each element of a profile's vocabulary should have a URI (IRI?) that identifies the term and information about the term (such as labels, definitions, etc.)

  	    The BPs also recommend that data be provided in multiple formats, and this is a good recommendation for profiles as well. If we take the point of view that profiles, like DCAT, have an abstract essence that can be made manifest in more than one way, we already have a good basis for satisfaction of BP14. (This will bring up the question that has already come up in the context of DCAT and conneg - are all of the forms equivalent? We may not be able to resolve that question.)

  	<p class="practicedesc">
  	   profiles should be published in standard data formats (BP12). It should also be stated that profiles should be published in and make use of technologies that are appropriate to the community which is expected to use them. A profile using RDF and OWL will not well serve a community that has only an XML/XSD-based skill set. This also relates to the above recommendation relating to providing data in multiple formats. In many communities the skills and data history can vary, so providing profiles with as many as possible of the commonly used technologies will increase the utility of the profile (as well as the profiled instance data).

  <div class="practice">	
  	<p>
  		<span id="bp1" class="practicelab">BP1 Provide metadata</span>
  	</p>
  	<p class="practicedesc">
In the BPoW this is defined as metadata about the dataset; with profiles this can be descriptive metadata within the profile or a separate metadata statement about the profile. (Since profiles themselves are generally forms of metadata they may be able to incorporate description and other administrative information about the profile within itself, if desired.) In addition there is a common set of administrative data that is recommended for many information resources such as dates and version designators for each version, and provenance (who or what agency created the digital file).

	  <div class="practice">	
	  	<p>
	  		<span id="bp12" class="practicelab">BP 2: Provide descriptive metadata</span>
	  	</p>
	  	<p class="practicedesc">
	The BPDoW limits its recommendation of metadata covering the topic of the dataset to general keywords and themes and categories (BP2). It may be desirable provide more specific topical information to satisfy the DXWG requirement that profiles should be discoverable by search engines. The quality of discoverability will vary based on the depth of description of the topic and/or community area that it serves. (We may wish to recommend some particulars.)

		  	<p>
		  		<span id="bp30" class="practicelab">BP30 Make feedback available</span>
		  	</p>
		  	<p class="practicedesc">
Ideally, the profile would have a management cycle for maintenance and updates. This should involve the community of users, as noted in BP29 (Gather feedback from data consumers) and BP30 (make feedback available). The strength and value of a profile will depend on the involvement of the community of users.

			  		<span id="bp27" class="practicelab">BP27 Preserve identifiers</span>
			  	</p>
			  	<p class="practicedesc">
			The aspect of the management cycle that is often ignored is that of the de-commissioning of datasets or of superseded versions. For users it is key that previously used identifiers always point to a useful document or message.

    <h2>The Profiles ontology</h2>
    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <div class="note">
      (Antoine:) What I have in mind for this section is to introduce the DXWG Profiles ontology. Say how it can support the requirements we identified, point to it, and suggest to use in contexts where an RDF / Linked Data description of the profiles and their associated resources can be made. If it's non-normative, it should be presented as a possible approach to implementing our recommendations, for example using a sentence like <i>The machine-readable version of the metadata on profiles and their links to associated resources may be provided using the Profiles ontology developed by the DXWG working group</i> (shamelessly inspired from how we've done it in the DWBP doc at https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#quality). I guess it should also reprise some points made at https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/323.

Ideally these would be using prof-o, on the condition that we still refer to prof-o as a suggestion not a formal recommendation (see the way it's been mentioned above).

          The term profile is widely used to refer to a document that describes how standards or specifications are deployed to support the requirements of a particular application, function, community, or context. In the metadata community, the term _application profile_has been applied to describe the tailoring of standards for specific applications.
