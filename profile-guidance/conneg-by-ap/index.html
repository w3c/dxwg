    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>
      A <dfn>profile</dfn> is a named set of constraints on one or more identified base specifications,
      including the identification of any implementing subclasses of datatypes,
      semantic interpretations, vocabularies, options and parameters of those base specifications
      necessary to accomplish a particular function.

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      In many cases, there are several ways to describe a resource within the scope of the media type.
      In the case of XML documents, for instance, the same content can be encoded using one of several
      DTDs or XML Schemas, whereas in RDF there is a wide choice of RDF vocabularies (classes and properties)
      available to describe resources of the same type. When a UA initiates a request, e.g., a GET request
      to retrieve or a PUT request to create or replace a resource, neither the UA nor the server have any
      possibility to exchange information on how the transmitted resource will be structured precisely.
      This can be accomplished by implementing content negotiation based on profiles.

      The necessary standardisation of the content-negotiation headers is done within the IETF. A first proposal
      for an <a href="https://profilenegotiation.github.io/I-D-Accept--Schema/I-D-accept-schema">Internet Draft
      for Negotiating Profiles in HTTP</a> is available but has not yet been submitted to the IETF. The current
      version of the draft (-00) is expected to be completely re-written in course of the process and should not
      be seen as anything but work-in-progress.
