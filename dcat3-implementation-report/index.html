      This document reports on evidence and implementations of the Data Catalog vocabulary version 3 (DCAT3) Candidate Recommendation [[VOCAB-DCAT-3]]. In particular, it demonstrates that the revisions proposed in [[VOCAB-DCAT-3]] are already in use and are also implementable.</section>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>DCAT is an RDF vocabulary, first published as a W3C Recommendation in 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT]], designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogs published on the Web. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/">Dataset Exchange Working Group</a> (<abbr title="Dataset Exchange Working Group">DXWG</abbr>) has developed a new version of DCAT [[VOCAB-DCAT-3]], which extends [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]] to support further use cases and requirements [[DCAT-UCR]]. These include the possibility of providing  digest for DCAT distributions, the support for resource's versioning and data series.</p>
<p>To show that the revisions proposed in [[VOCAB-DCAT-3]] are implementable and adopted, we collected evidence in the form of vocabularies, data catalogs, data services, and datasets (<a href="#evidence"></a>). The results are summarized in this report.</p>
      <section id="methodology">
        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <p>We followed the steps described below to collect evidence for the revisions proposed in [[VOCAB-DCAT-3]]:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Identify the actual list of revisions proposed in [[VOCAB-DCAT-3]] for which implementation evidence should be collected (see <a href="#proposed-revisions"></a> for more details).</li>
        <li>Review existing vocabularies based on [[VOCAB-DCAT]] or [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]], and identify if they include already the changes proposed in [[VOCAB-DCAT-3]], and/or their alignment with [[VOCAB-DCAT-3]] is planned. The rationale for including also planned implementations is that these vocabularies are not likely to adopt the revisions proposed in [[VOCAB-DCAT-3]] until it becomes a W3C Recommendation.</li>
        <li>Review existing guidelines and implementation reports of [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]], as well as of vocabularies based on it, to verify if the changes proposed [[VOCAB-DCAT-3]] are implemented in existing data catalogs, data services, and datasets.</li>
        <li>Develop an Implementation Report with details of the steps above.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>As noted, to have a broader coverage of [[VOCAB-DCAT-3]] adoption we considered different types of evidence:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>DCAT-based vocabularies</li>
          <li>Data catalogs, data services, and datasets</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This report includes only a representative subset, providing nonetheless enough implementation evidence of the revisions proposed in [[VOCAB-DCAT-3]].</p>
      </section>
      <section id="exit-criteria">
        <h3>Meeting the exit criteria</h3>
        <p>As described in the <abbr title="Dataset Exchange Working Group">DXWG</abbr> <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/charter">charter</a>, to advance to Proposed Recommendation, evidence will be adduced in order to demonstrate that each of the changes made to the original DCAT Recommendation [[VOCAB-DCAT]] has been published and consumed independently in catalogs and related systems at least once, although a higher number is expected for the majority of terms.</p>
<p>Evidence of implementation was gathered from existing data catalogs, data services, and datasets, which already implement the proposed changes, as well as from existing application profiles of [[VOCAB-DCAT]].</p>

        <section id="proposed-revisions">
      <h2>Summary of proposed revisions</h2>
      <p>The following table shows the set of changes proposed in [[VOCAB-DCAT-3]].</p>

<aside class="note">
<p> <code>dcat:Resource</code> is an abstract class that is not supposed to be used directly, as explained in <a data-cite="VOCAB-DCAT-2#dcat-scope">&sect;&nbsp;<span class="secno">5.1 </span>DCAT scope</a> of [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]]. The properties are considered when inherited by a sub-class of <code>dcat:Resource</code>.</p>
<!--
<p>Quoting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a data-cite="VOCAB-DCAT-2#Class:Resource"><code>dcat:Resource</code></a> represents a dataset, a data service or any other resource that may be described by a metadata record in a catalog. This class is not intended to be used directly, but is the parent class of <a data-cite="VOCAB-DCAT-2#Class:Dataset"><code>dcat:Dataset</code></a>, <a data-cite="VOCAB-DCAT-2#Class:Data_Service"><code>dcat:DataService</code></a> and <a data-cite="VOCAB-DCAT-2#Class:Catalog"><code>dcat:Catalog</code></a>. Member items in a catalog should be members of one of the sub-classes, or of a sub-class of these, or of a sub-class of <a data-cite="VOCAB-DCAT-2#Class:Resource"><code>dcat:Resource</code></a> defined in a DCAT profile or other DCAT application. <a data-cite="VOCAB-DCAT-2#Class:Resource"><code>dcat:Resource</code></a> is effectively an extension point for defining a catalog of any kind of resource. <a data-cite="VOCAB-DCAT-2#Class:Dataset"><code>dcat:Dataset</code></a> and <a data-cite="VOCAB-DCAT-2#Class:Data_Service"><code>dcat:DataService</code></a> can be used for datasets and services which are not documented in any catalog.</p>

<p>The criteria used to select the relevant vocabularies are the following ones:</p>

<ol>
<li>They are based on [[VOCAB-DCAT-3]] or they extend [[VOCAB-DCAT]] with properties and classes included in [[VOCAB-DCAT-3]].</li>
<li>Preferably, they are used across multiple data catalogs and/or domains/disciplines.</li>
</ol>

<!--p>At the time this report was written, it was not possible to identify vocabularies based on [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]]. However, there are quite a few vocabularies extending [[VOCAB-DCAT]] - a non-exhaustive list is included in <a data-cite="VOCAB-DCAT-2#profiles">&sect;&nbsp;<span class="secno">14 </span>DCAT Profiles</a> of [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]]. Among these, we have selected the most representative ones, for geographic and domain coverage as well as tooling support, which already include at least some of the revisions proposed in [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]], and/or whose alignment with [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]] is under way or planned.</p-->

<p>The vocabularies listed earlier in this section have been chosen for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>[[DCAT-AP]] is a profile of [[VOCAB-DCAT]] used across Europe since 2014 as a metadata interchange format, primarily for catalogs of government data, and, to some extent, for scientific data. As such, it has a broad geographic coverage, and it is supported in data catalogs (e.g., the <a href="https://data.europa.eu">European Data Portal</a>) and catalog platforms (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-dcat">CKAN</a>). This report considers [[DCAT-AP-3]] that is the latest  editor's draft release.</li>
<li>[[DCAT-EP]] is an extension of the DCAT Application Profile for European data portals (DCAT-AP), designed and used for documenting datasets and data services of the European Parliament.</li>
<li>[[GeoDCAT-AP-2]] is domain-specific extension of [[DCAT-AP]] for geospatial and statistical data, respectively, and they share the same geographic coverage of [[VOCAB-DCAT]].</li>
</ul>  
 <p> Furthermore, the [[DataEuropaPortal]] serves as a pivotal hub for accessing European open data across a spectrum of sources, including international, European Union, national, regional, local, and geodata portals. It amalgamates the former EU Open Data Portal and the European Data Portal into a cohesive platform.
 Datasets available through the portal are considered as proof of implementation for a DCAT 3 features.</p>   
<p>[[DCAT-AP]] has also been used as a basis for the development of country-specific extensions (see [[DCAT-AP-EXT]]). Such extensions have not been included in this report, but they provide additional support to the implementation evidence for the revisions proposed in [[VOCAB-DCAT-3]] already included in [[DCAT-AP-3]].</p>

      <h2>Implementation Evidence</h2>
      <p>The table below shows the evidence collected for each one of the revisions proposed in [[VOCAB-DCAT-3]], including, for each revision, the existing implementations - flagged with "&#x2714;" -, as well as the planned implementations - flagged with "(&#x2714;)". The vocabularies and data catalogs/data services/datasets corresponding to columns in this table are listed in subsequent sections.</p>
      <p>The reported planned implementations reflect the following (not mutually exclusive) scenarios:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The vocabulary or the metadata schema of the data catalog is being aligned with [[VOCAB-DCAT-3]] (or this alignment is planned).</li>
        <li>The vocabulary or data catalog supports equivalent or similar properties and classes, that may be eventually replaced by those defined in [[VOCAB-DCAT-3]].</li>
