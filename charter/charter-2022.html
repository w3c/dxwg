        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Sharing data among researchers, governments and citizens, whether openly or not, requires the provision of metadata. Different communities use different metadata standards to describe their datasets, some of which are highly specialized. At a general level W3C’s Data Catalog Vocabulary, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/">DCAT</a>, is in widespread use, but so too are <a href="https://ckan.org/">CKAN</a>’s native schema, schema.org's <a href="http://schema.org/Dataset">dataset description</a> vocabulary, <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=26020">ISO 19115</a>, <a href="http://www.ddialliance.org/explore-documentation">DDI</a>, <a href="https://sdmx.org/">SDMX</a>, <a href="http://www.eurocris.org/cerif/main-features-cerif">CERIF</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/void/" title="Describing Linked Datasets with the VoID Vocabulary">VoID</a>, <a href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/101">INSPIRE</a> and, in the healthcare and life sciences domain, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/hcls-dataset/">Dataset Description vocabulary</a> and <a href="https://github.com/biocaddie/WG3-MetadataSpecifications">DATS</a> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/103143" title="DATS: the data tag suite to enable discoverability of datasets">ref</a>) among others.  This variety is a clear indication that no single vocabulary offers a complete and universally accepted solution. </p>

        <p>DCAT has known gaps in coverage, for example around time series and versions. DCAT has been successful and is in wide use, but these gaps must be addressed if usage is to continue to grow across different communities and the variety of metadata schemas is to reduce.</p>

        <p>Maximizing interoperability between services such as data catalogs, e-Infrastructures and virtual research environments requires not just the use of standard vocabularies but of <em>application profiles</em>. These define how a vocabulary is used, for example by providing cardinality constraints and/or enumerated lists of allowed values such that data can be validated. The development of several application profiles based on DCAT, such as the European Commission's <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/dcat_application_profile/description">DCAT-AP</a> is particularly noteworthy in this regard.</p>
        <p>Rather than limit the number of metadata standards and application profiles in use, systems should be able to expose and ingest (meta)-data according to multiple standards through transparent and sustainable interfaces. We thus need a mechanism for servers to indicate the available standards and application profiles, and for clients to choose an appropriate one. This leads to the concept of content negotiation by application profile, which is orthogonal to content negotiation by data format and language that is already part of HTTP. A new <a href="https://profilenegotiation.github.io/I-D-Profile-Negotiation/I-D-Profile-Negotiation">Internet Draft on profile negotiation</a> currently under development at IETF with input from the Dataset Exchange Working Group, is based on the <a href="http://profilenegotiation.github.io/I-D-Accept--Schema/I-D-accept-schema"> draft</a> presented at the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/11/sdsvoc/report#conneg">SDSVoc workshop</a>. The combination of DXWG's definition of what is meant by "application profile", together with the DXWG view of how clients and servers may interact in different ways based on these profiles, together with this external work will provide a powerful means to exchange data in any format (JSON, RDF, XML etc.) according to declared structures against which the data can be validated.</p>
        <p>The goals of the working group are to maintain the version 2 of DCAT and extend the standard to version 3 in line with work done to date and the ongoing work on dataset exchange being undertaken by communities more generally, and to develop to a recommendation the work undertaken in the 2017-2019 charter period on content negotiation by profile.</p>

      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>DCAT is formulated as an RDF vocabulary and is expected to remain so, however, as with all earlier work, the working Group is agnostic about data formats. Methods for expressing DCAT in other (existing) formats are in scope.</p>
        <p>Government data, scientific research data, industry/enterprise and cultural heritage data, whether shared openly or not, are all explicitly in scope.  The working group will primarily look at cross-domain requirements.</p>
                        <section id="input-documents">
                            <h3>Input Documents</h3>
                            <p>The following documents <i>SHOULD</i> be considered by the Working Group as direct inputs to the specifications to be developed.</p>

                            <h5>Existing Project Materials</h5>
                            <p>In the course of the first charter period of the Dataset Exchange Working Group material was developed which did not get used in the documents published as recommendations and notes, these include various things on  the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg">DXWG Github</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/wiki/Main_Page">project wiki</a>, but particularly those Github issues marked as <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afuture-work">Future-work</a>.</p>

                            <h5>W3C documents</h5>

	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
    <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, the WG should show that each term in the revised version of DCAT is used in multiple catalogs and related systems. As a minimum, evidence will be adduced that each term has been published and consumed independently at least once, although a higher number is expected for the majority of terms.</p>
    <p>For the content negotiation by application profile specification, each fall back mechanism identified by the Working Group is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">two independent implementations</a>. The DXWG is not responsible for proving implementations of the RFC defined at IETF.</p>
	  <p>Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
    <p>Each specification should have a testing plan, some guide to help implementers know if they have followed the specification correctly.</p>
	</section>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
          W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

          Communication
        </h2>
        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/dx">Dataset Exchange Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Dataset Exchange Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work: on the public mailing list <a id="public-email" href="mailto:public-dxwg-wg@w3.org">public-dxwg-wg@w3.org</a> (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dxwg-wg/">archive</a>). The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'>one week to 10 working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
