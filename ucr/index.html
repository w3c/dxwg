    <section id="Methodology">
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
		This Working Group was formed based on the Smart Descriptions & Smarter Vocabularies (SDSVoc) workshop held in Amsterdam November 30-December 1, 2016. The first  
		Working Group meeting was held May 18, 2017.  At that meeting the Working Group Chairs called for Working Group members and other stakeholders to submit use cases 
		on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/wiki/Use_Case_Working_Space">Working Group's wiki</a>. 
		<p>Use cases were written using a template, which required use case authors to provide a problem statement, list of stakeholders experiencing the problem, and 
		   requirements suggested given the problem. If possible, use case authors were asked to provide references to existing approaches that might be useful for DCAT, 
		   links to documens and projects the use case references, related user cases, and editorial comments. A list of tags below, also was created and applied to the 
		   use cases to reorganize them on demand.</p> 
		<p>Working Group Chairs, grouped related use cases for discussion. Use cases were discussed during the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/wiki/Meetings">Working Group's weekly meetings</a>
		   and an intensive two day <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/wiki/Oxford_Attendance_and_logistics">face-to-face meeting</a> held at the Oxford e-Research 
		   Centre, University of Oxford, July 17-18, 2017. After the discussion of each use case, a proposal to accept the use case as-is, accept the use case with changes, 
		   or reject the use case was put before Working Group members in attendance for a vote.</p> 
		<p>The requirements were derived from the accepted use cases. One of the key tasks for the editors of this document was removing duplicate requirements, 
		   editing those that remained and adding missing ones. The editors also ensured links from requirements to use cases were maintained.</p> 
		
		<p>TODO...discuss intial meeting in Amsterdam, Wiki for gathering UCs and requirements, discussed and edited during WG's phone calls and F2F in Oxford.

				In practice, distributions are sometimes made available in a packaged or compressed format.
				For example, a group of files may be packaged in a ZIP file, or a single large file may be compressed.

          <p>Most datasets that are maintained long-term and evolve over time have distributions of multiple versions. However, the current DCAT model does not cover versioning with sufficient details. Being able to publish dataset version information in a standard way will help both producers publishing their data on data catalogues or archiving data and dataset consumers who want discover new versions of a give dataset, etc. We can also see some similarities with software versioning and dataset versioning, for instance, some data projects release daily dataset distributions, major/minor releases etc. Probably, we can use some of the lessons learned from software versioning. There are several existing dataset description models that extend DCAT to provide versioning information, for example, HCLS Community Profile.</p>
        </p>
        <p class="existing_approaches">
          <p>[VOCAB-DCAT] does not provide guidance on how to model this information. [DCAT-AP] and [GeoDCAT-AP] partially support these requirements - namely, the specification of dataset authors (<code>dcterms:creator</code> [DCTerms]), data lineage (<code>dcterms:provenance</code> [DCTerms]), and input data (<code>dcterms:source</code> [DCTerms]). For the two remaining requirements, the JRC metadata schema makes use of <code>dcterms:isReferencedBy</code> [DCTerms] (publications) and <code>vann:usageNote</code> [VANN] (usage notes).</p>
          <p>These solutions allow a simplified description of the dataset <i>context</i>, that can be used for multiple purposes - as assessing the quality and fitness for use of a dataset, or identifying the dataset most commonly used as input data. Additional details could be provided by representing more precisely these relationship with "qualified" forms by using vocabularies as [PROV-O], [VOCAB-DQV], or [VOCAB-DUV]: for instance, the relationship between a dataset and input data can be complemented with the model used for processing them, and possibly with additional information on the data generation workflow.</p>

          <p>There are multiple reasons to provide different information about the same concept, so if Linked Data is to exist based on URI object identifiers, and these are to relate to the real world entity, rather than specific implementations (i.e. information records), then it is inevitable that different sets of information will be required for different purposes.</p>
          <p>Consider a request for the boundary of a country, with a coastline. If the coastline is included as a property, this may be many megabytes of detail. Alternatively, a generalised simple coastline may be provided, or a single point, or may not be required at all. (In reality there may be many different versions of coastline based on different legal definitions, or practices, or approximation methods). </p>
          <p>Furthermore, in any graph based response, the depth of traversal of the graph is always a choice. Consider a request to the GBIF taxonomy service to search for a biological species. A response typically includes not just the species, but potentially more information about the hierarchy of the taxomony (kingdom, phyla, family, genus etc) - also possible synonyms, also possibly a wide range of metadata about name sources, usages and history. There is a need for offering different choices of how deep such a traversal of relationships should be undertaken and returned.</p>
          <p>Different information models (response schema), and different choices of content within the same schema , constitute necessary options, and there may be a large number of these.</p>
          <p>Thus there is a need for discovering which profiles a service will offer for a given resource, and a canonical machine readable graph of metadata about what such offerings consist of and how they may be invoked. This may be as simple as providing a profile name, or content profile, schema choice, encoding and languages.</p>
          <p>Note that the Linked Data API implementation used by the UK Linked Data effort, includes the notion of _view parameters in URI requests - these are "named collections of properties" but it does not provide a means to attach metadata about what such views consist of. equivalent HTTP header based profile negotiation would still need to address this requirement in the same way as agent-driven negotiation (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec12.html">https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec12.html</a>) - what is required is a minimal set of metadata and extension mechanisms for this.</p>
          <p>Support for a specific profile is also a powerful search axis, potentially encompassing the full suite of semantic specification and resource interoperability requirements. Thus metadata about profile support can be used for  both discovery and mediated traversal via forms of content negotiation.</p>

          <p>Users often access datasets via <i>web services</i>. DCAT provides constructs for associating a resource described by dcat:Dataset with dcat:Distribution descriptions. However, the Distribution class provides only the dcat:accessURL and dcat:downloadURL properties for users to access/download something. It would be useful for users to gain more information about the web service endpoint and how users can interact with the data. If information about the web service is known with appropriate identifiers for the data, then users can understand additional context then invoke a call to the web service to access/download the dataset resource or subsets of it.</p>

          <p>We want to be able to describe a dataset record using properties appropriate to the dataset type. This is especially the case in a dataset in the geoscience domain, e.g. an observation of a "feature" in the real world captured using a sensor about some property. There are emerging practices on how to represent these semantics for the data, however, DCAT currently only supports association of a dcat:Dataset with dcat:theme to a skos:Concept. Data providers could extend/specialise dcat:theme to provide specific semantics about the association between dcat:Dataset and the &#x2018;theme&#x2019; but is this enough? Furthermore, there are broad/aggregated semantics at the dataset level (e.g. observations in the Great Barrier Reef) and then fine grained semantics for elements within a dataset (e.g. sea surface temperature observations in the Great Barrier Reef). 
Users need a way to view the aggregated collection level metadata and the associated semantics and then they need a way to view record level metadata to obtain/filter on specific information, e.g. instrument/sensor used, spatial feature, observable property, quantity kind, etc. </p>
          <p>Properties from the W3C Semantic Sensor Network SOSA ontology and QUDT may be useful in this context.  </p>

          <p>In order to provide a single access and discovery point to JRC data, in 2016 <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/">a corporate data catalog</a> has been launched, where datasets are documented by using a modular metadata schema, consisting of a <i>core</i> profile, defining the elements that should be common to all metadata records, and a set of <i>domain-specific extensions</i>.</p>
          <p>The reference metadata standard used is the <i>DCAT application profile for European data portals</i> [DCAT-AP] (the <i>de facto</i> EU standard metadata interchange format), and the related domain-specific extensions - namely, [GeoDCAT-AP], for geospatial metadata, and [StatDCAT-AP], for statistical metadata. The core profile of JRC metadata is however not using [DCAT-AP] as is, but it complements it with a number of metadata elements that have been identified as most relevant across scientific domains, and which are required in order to support data citation.</p>
          <p>More precisely, the most common, cross-domain requirements identified at JRC are following ones:</p>
          <ul>
        <li> Ability to indicate dataset authors.</li>
        <li> Ability to describe data lineage.</li>
        <li> Ability to give potential data consumers information on how to use the data ("usage notes").</li>
        <li> Ability to link to scientific publications about a dataset.</li>
        <li> Ability to link to input data (i.e., data used to create a dataset).</li>

        <p class="description">
          <p>A number of different (possibly persistent) identifiers are widely used in the scientific community, especially for publications, but now increasingly for authors and data.</p>
          <p>Different approaches are used for representing them in RDF &#x2013; best practices are needed to enable their effective use across platforms. But more importantly, they need to be made actionable, irrespective of the platforms they are used in.</p>
          <p>Encoding identifiers as HTTP URIs seems to be the most effective way of making them actionable. Notably, quite a few identifier schemes can be encoded as dereferenceable HTTP URIs, and some of them are also returning machine readable metadata (e.g., DOIs, ORCIDs). Moreover, they can still be encoded as literals, especially if there is the need of knowing the identifier &#x201C;type&#x201D;. In such a case, a common identifier type registry would ensure interoperability.</p>
          <p>Another issue concerns the ability to specify primary and secondary identifiers. This may be a requirement when resources are associated with multiple identifiers.</p>
        </p>
        <p class="existing_approaches">
          <p>When encoded as HTTP URIs, the usual approach to model primary and alternative identifiers is to use the former as the resource URI, whereas the latter are specified by using <code>owl:sameAs</code>. In this case, the information about the identifier type is not explicitly specified, and can be derived only from the URI syntax - although this is not always possible.</p>
          <p>To model identifiers as literals, [VOCAB-DCAT] uses <code>dcterms:identifier</code>, but it makes no distinction between primary / alternative identifiers, or the identifier type. For alternative identifiers, [DCAT-AP] recommends class <code>adms:Identifier</code> [VOCAB-ADMS], which can be used to specify the identifier type, plus additional information - namely, the identifier scheme agency and the identifier issue date. It is worth noting that the <code>adms:Identifier</code> has the primary purpose of describing the identifier itself, which makes it less suitable for linking purposes.</p>
          <p>Finally, a number of vocabularies have defined specific properties for modeling identifier types, as <code>prism:doi</code> [PRISM] and <code>bibo:doi</code> [BIBO] for DOIs. Moreover, starting from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://schema.org/version/3.2/">version 3.2</a>, [SCHEMA-ORG] has defined a super-property <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://schema.org/identifier"><code>schema:identifier</code></a> for all the identifier-specific properties already used in [SCHEMA-ORG].</p>
          <p>An alternative approach is to denote the identifier type with an RDF datatype. In such a case, the same property can be used to specify the identifier - e.g., <code>dcterms:identifier</code>. This solution has the advantage of being able to easily identify all literals used as identifiers (you just have to lookup / search for the same property), whereas the datatype can be used to filter specific identifier types.</p>
          <p>KC: Note that the libraries/archives community has identifiers that are not (yet) actionable, like ISBNs, ISSNs. These can be coded as dcterms:identifier strings but the string itself is not unique. Not sure how these fit into the overall picture but perhaps we can task someone to bring a specific proposal.</p>

          <p>Documentation on data lineage is crucial to ensure transparency on how data are created and to facilitate their reproducibility.

          <p>Data lineage is typically specified with a more or less detailed human-targeted documentation.

        <p class="description">
          <p>Each metadata standard has its own set of agent roles, and they all use their own vocabularies / code lists. E.g., the latest version (2014) of [ISO-19115] has <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://geo-ide.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php?title=ISO_19115_and_19115-2_CodeList_Dictionaries#CI_RoleCode">20 roles</a>, and [DataCite] even more.</p>
          <p>Two of the main issues concern (a) how to ensure interoperability across roles defined in different standards, and (b) if it makes sense to support all of them across platforms. The latter point follows from a common issue in metadata standards supporting multiple roles, with overlapping semantics (e.g., the difference between a data distributor and a data publisher is not always clear). In these scenarios, whenever metadata are not created by specialists, roles frequently happen to be used inconsistently.</p>
          <p>As far as research data are concerned, agent roles are important to denote the type of contribution provided by each individual / organization in producing data. </p>
          <p>Moreover, in some cases, an additional requirement is to specify the temporal dimension of a role &#x2013; i.e., the time frame during which an individual / organisation played a given role - and, maybe, also other information &#x2013; e.g., the organisation where the individual held a given position while playing that role.</p>
        </p>
        <p class="existing_approaches">
          <p>[DCTerms] defines a limited number of agent roles as properties. [VOCAB-DCAT] re-uses some of them (in particular, <code>dcterms:publisher</code>), plus it defines a new one, namely, <code>dcat:contactPoint</code>. [DCAT-AP] and [GeoDCAT-AP] provide guidance on the use of other [DCTerms] roles - in particular, <code>dcterms:creator</code>, <code>dcterms:rightsHolder</code>. Anyway, the role properties defined in [DCTerms] and [VOCAB-DCAT] model just a subset of the agent roles defined in other standards. Moreover, they cannot be used to associate a role with other information concerning its temporal / organizational context.</p>
          <p>[PROV-O] could be used for this purpose by using a &#x201C;qualified attribution&#x201D;. This is, for instance, the approach used in [GeoDCAT-AP] to model agent roles defined in [ISO-19115] but not supported in [DCTerms] and [VOCAB-DCAT]:</p>
          <pre>
a:Dataset a dcat:Dataset; 
  prov:qualifiedAttribution [ a prov:Attribution&#xA0;;
# The agent role, as per ISO 19115
    dcterms:type &lt;http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/ResponsiblePartyRole/owner&gt;&#xA0;;
# The agent playing that role
    prov:agent [ a foaf:Organization&#xA0;;
      foaf:name "European Union"@en ] ] .</pre>
          <p>However, to address the different use cases, such &#x201C;qualified roles&#x201D; should be compatible with the corresponding non-qualified forms, and both should be mutually inferable. For instance, the example above in [GeoDCAT-AP] is considered as equivalent to:</p>
          <pre>
a:Dataset a dcat:Dataset;
  dcterms:rightsHolder [ a foaf:Organization&#xA0;;
    foaf:name "European Union"@en ] .</pre>

          <p>Used in its broader sense, the notion of "data quality" covers different aspects, that may vary depending on the domain.</p>
          <p>They include, but are not limited to:</p>
          <ul>
        <li> Fitness for purpose.</li>
        <li> Data precision / accuracy.</li>
        <li> Compliance with given quality benchmarks, standards, specifications.</li>
        <li> Quality assessments based on data review / users' feedback.</li>
      </ul>
          <p>In order to provide a mechanism for the consistent representation of data quality, the most frequently used data quality aspects should be identified, based on existing standards (e.g., [ISO-19115]) and practices. Such aspects should also be used to identify possible common modeling patterns.</p>
        </p>
        <p class="existing_approaches">
          <p>Solutions for modeling data quality have been defined in [DCAT-AP], [GeoDCAT-AP], [StatDCAT-AP], [VOCAB-DQV], and [VOCAB-DUV]. They cover the following aspects:</p>
          <ul>
        <li> Metadata conformance with a metadata standard.</li>
        <li> Data conformance with a given data schema/model.</li>
        <li> Data conformance with a given reference system (spatial or temporal).</li>
        <li> Data conformance with a given quality specification / benchmark.</li>
        <li> Associating data with a quality report.</li>
        <li> Spatial / temporal resolution. </li>
        <li> Data quality assessments expressed with quantitative test results.</li>
        <li> Data quality assessments via users&#x2019; feedback.</li>
      </ul>
          <p>Notably, the first 4 aspects (those related to "conformance") follow a common pattern in that the reference vocabularies model all them by using property <code>dcterms:conformsTo</code> [DCTerms].</p>

          <p>Understanding the level of precision and accuracy of a dataset is fundamental to verify its fitness for purpose. This is typically denoted in terms of spatial or temporal resolution, but other dimensions are also possible.</p>
          <p>Some metadata standards include elements for specifying precision. For instance the latest version (2014) of [ISO-19115] supports the possibility of specifying spatial resolution in terms of scale (e.g., 1:1,000,000), distance - further split into horizontal ground distance, vertical distance, and angular distance - and level of detail. However, [VOCAB-DCAT] does not provide guidance on how to model this information. </p>
          <p>Actually, for some time, [VOCAB-DCAT] included a property <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-vocab-dcat-20120405/#property--granularity"><code>dcat:granularity</code></a> to model precision, which was dropped in the final version of the vocabulary (see <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/2011/gld/track/issues/10">ISSUE-10</a>, and, in particular, the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-gld-wg/2013Jan/0053.html">mail</a> proposing to drop this property).</p>
        </p>
        <p class="existing_approaches">
          <p>This issue was raised during the development of [VOCAB-DQV], and a solution has been proposed on how to model data precision in terms of spatial resolution - expressed as equivalent scale (e.g., 1:1,000,000) or distance (e.g., 1km) - and data accuracy as percentage - see [VOCAB-DQV], <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dqv/#h-expressdatasetaccuracyprecision">Section 6.13 <i>Express dataset precision and accuracy</i></a>. Notably, the same approach can be followed to model temporal resolution. </p>
          <p>[SDWBP] addresses this problem as well re-using the approach defined in [VOCAB-DQV], and, additionally, it provides an example on how to specify accuracy by stating conformance with a quality standard - see [SDWBP], <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#desc-accuracy">Best Practice 14: <i>Describe the positional accuracy of spatial data</i></a>.</p>

          <p>One of the ways of expressing data quality is to verify whether a given dataset is (or not) conformant with a given quality standard / benchmark.</p>
          <p>[ISO-19115] supports a way of modeling this information, by allowing to state whether a given dataset passed or not a given test result. Moreover, [INSPIRE-MD] extends this approach by supporting an additional possible result, namely, "not evaluated".</p>
          <p>Another approach is provided by the [EARL] vocabulary, which provides a generic mechanisms to model test results. More precisely, [EARL] supports the following possible outcome values (quoting from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/#OutcomeValue">Section 2.7 <i>OutcomeValue Class</i></a>):</p>

          <p>[VOCAB-DQV] allows to specify data conformance with a reference quality standard / benchmark. However, this can model only one of the possible scenarios - i.e., when data are <i>conformant</i>. </p>
          <p>[GeoDCAT-AP] provides an alternative and extended way of expressing "conformance" by using [PROV-O], allowing the specification of additional information about conformance tests (when this has been carried out, by whom, etc.), but also different conformance test results (namely, <i>conformant</i>, <i>not conformant</i>, <i>not evaluated</i>).</p>
          <p>An example of the [GeoDCAT-AP] [PROV-O]-based representation of conformance is provided by the following code snippet:</p>
          <pre>
a:Dataset a dcat:Dataset&#xA0;;
  prov:wasUsedBy a:TestingActivity .
a:TestingActivity a prov:Activity&#xA0;;
  prov:generated a:TestResult&#xA0;;

          <p>The types of possible access restrictions of a dataset are one of the key filtering criteria for data consumers. For instance, while searching in a data catalogue, I may not be interested in those data I cannot access (closed data), or in those data requiring I provide personal information (as data that can be accessible by anyone, but only after registration).</p>
          <p>Moreover, it is often the case that different distributions of the same dataset are released with different access restrictions. For instance, a dataset containing sensitive information (as personal data) should not be publicly accessible, although it would be possible to openly release a distribution where these data are aggregated and/or anonymized.</p>
          <p>Finally, whenever data are not publicly available, an explanation of a reason why they are closed should be provided - especially when these data are maintained by public authorities, or are the outcomes of public-funded research activities.</p>
        </p>
        <p class="existing_approaches">
          <p>[DCAT-AP] models this information at the dataset level by using property <code>dcterms:accessRights</code> [DCTerms], and defines three possible values:</p>
          <blockquote>
        <dl>
          <dt>Public</dt>
          <dd>Definition: Publicly accessible by everyone.</dd>
          <dd>Usage note/comment: Permissible obstacles include: registration and request for API keys, as long as anyone can request such registration and/or API keys.</dd>
          <dt>Restricted</dt>
          <dd>Definition: Only available under certain conditions.</dd>
          <dd>Usage note/comment: This category may include: resources that require payment, resources shared under non-disclosure agreements, resources for which the publisher or owner has not yet decided if they can be publicly released.</dd>
          <dt>Non-public</dt>
          <dd>Definition: Not publicly accessible for privacy, security or other reasons.</dd>
          <dd>Usage note/comment: This category may include resources that contain sensitive or personal information.</dd>
        </dl>
      </blockquote>
          <p>In addition to this, the JRC extension to [DCAT-AP] uses property <code>dcterms:accessRights</code> also at the distribution level, with the following possible values:</p>
          <dl>
        <dt>no limitations</dt>
        <dd>The distribution can be anonymously accessed</dd>
        <dt>registration required</dt>
        <dd>The distribution can be accessed by anyone, but only after registration</dd>
        <dt>authorization required</dt>
        <dd>The distribution can be accessed only by authorized users</dd>

          <p>This concerns how to model dataset distributions available via services / APIs (e.g., a SPARQL endpoint), and not via direct file download. In such cases, it is necessary to know how to query the service / API to get the data. Moreover, an additional issue is that a service may provide access to more than one dataset. As a consequence, users do not know how to get access to the relevant subset of data accessible via a service / API.</p>
          <p>Although this is a domain-independent issue, it is a key one in the geospatial domain, where data are typically made accessible via services (e.g., a view or download service), that, to be used, require specific clients. In metadata, the link to such services is usually pointing to an XML document describing the service's "capabilities". This of course puzzles non-expert users, who expect instead to get the actual "data".</p>
          <p>Some catalogue platforms (as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://geonetwork-opensource.org/">GeoNetwork</a> and, to some extent, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN</a>) are able to make this transparent for some services (typically, view services), but not for all. It would therefore be desirable to agree on a cross-domain and cross-platform approach to deal with this issue.</p>
          <p>In [VOCAB-DCAT], the option of accessing data via a service / API is explicitly mentioned, recommending the use of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#Property:distribution_accessurl">dcat:accessURL</a> to point to it. However, this property is meant to be used, generically, for <i>indirect</i> data download, so it is not enough to know that the URL points to a service endpoint rather than to a download page.</p>
          <p>Actually, for some time, [VOCAB-DCAT] included a class <code><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-vocab-dcat-20120405/#Class:_WebService">dcat:WebService</a></code> (subclass of <code>dcat:Distribution</code>) to specify that data is available via a service / API. Other subclasses of <code>dcat:Distribution</code> were also defined to specify direct data access (<code><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-vocab-dcat-20120405/#Class:_Download">dcat:Download</a></code>), and data access via an RSS/Atom feed (<code><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-vocab-dcat-20120405/#Class:_Feed">dcat:Feed</a></code>). All these subclasses were dropped in the final version of the vocabulary (see <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/2011/gld/track/issues/8">ISSUE-8</a> / <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/2011/gld/track/issues/9">ISSUE-9</a>, and related discussion).</p>
        </p>
        <p class="existing_approaches">
          <p>A proposal to address this issue has been elaborated in the framework of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/2016/11/sdsvoc/SDSVoc16_paper_25#ref-DCAT-AP-IG">the <i>DCAT-AP implementation guidelines</i></a> (see issue <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/dcat_application_profile/issue/dt2-service-based-data-access"><i>DT2: Service-based data access</i></a>), where two main requirements have been identified:</p>
          <ol>
        <li> Denote distributions as pointing to a service / API, and not directly to the actual data.</li>
        <li> Provide a description of the API / service interface, along with the relevant query parameters, that can be directly used by software agents - either to access the data, or to make transparent data access to end users.</li>
      </ol>
          <p>As far as point (1) is concerned, the proposal is to associate with distributions the following information:</p>
          <ul>
        <li> Whether the access / download URL of a distribution points to data or to a service / API (<code>dcterms:type</code>).</li>
        <li> In the latter case, we include the specification the service/API conforms to (<code>dcterms:conformsTo</code>).</li>
      </ul>
          <p>An example is provided by the following code snippet. Here, the distribution's access URL points to service, implemented by using the [WMS] standard of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC):</p>
          <pre>
a:Dataset a dcat:Dataset; 
  dcat:distribution [ a dcat:Distribution&#xA0;;
    dct:title "GMIS - WMS (9km)"@en&#xA0;;
    dct:description "Web Map Service (WMS) - GetCapabilities"@en&#xA0;;
    dct:license &lt;http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/licence/COM_REUSE&gt;&#xA0;;
    dcat:accessURL &lt;http://gmis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/webservices/9km/wms/meris/?dataset=kd490&gt;&#xA0;;
# The distribution points to a service
    dct:type &lt;http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/distribution-type/WEB_SERVICE&gt;&#xA0;;
# The service conforms to the WMS specification
    dct:conformsTo &lt;http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms&gt; ] .</pre>
          <p>About (2) (i.e., provide a description of the API / service interface), a number options have been discussed (e.g., describe a service/API by using an <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.opensearch.org/">OpenSearch</a> document), but no final decision has been taken.</p>

          <p>In most cases, the relationships between datasets and related resources (e.g., author, publisher, contact point, publications / documentation, input data, model(s) / software used to create the dataset) can be specified with simple, binary properties available from widely used vocabularies - as [DCTerms] and [VOCAB-DCAT].</p>
          <p>However, there may be the need of providing additional information concerning, e.g., the temporal context of a relationship, which requires the use of a more sophisticated representation, similar to the "qualified" forms used in [PROV-O]. </p>
          <p>Besides [PROV-O], vocabularies as [VOCAB-DQV] and [VOCAB-DUV] can be used for this purpose. However, there is the need of providing guidance on how to use them consistently, since the lack of modeling patterns results in the difficulty of aggregating this information across metadata records and catalogs.</p>
          <p>Moreover, it is important to define mappings between qualified and non-qualified forms (e.g., along the lines of what done in [PROV-DC]), not only to make it clear their semantic relationships (e.g., <code>dcterms:source</code> is the non-qualified form of <code>prov:qualifiedDerivation</code>), but also to enable metadata sharing and re-use across catalogs that may support only one of the two forms (qualified / non-qualified).</p>

          <p>[VOCAB-DCAT] makes use of quite a general definition of dataset (quoting from [VOCAB-DCAT], <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#class-dataset">Section 5.3 <i>Class: Dataset</i></a>: "A collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more formats."), which is meant to be used as broady as possible (as stated in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/2011/gld/track/issues/62">ISSUE-62</a>).</p>
          <p>As such, it could be theoretically used to model a variety of resources - including documents, software, images and audio-visual content. However, the solution adopted in [VOCAB-DCAT] is not able to address the following scenarios:</p>
          <ol>
        <li> Let's suppose that a data catalog includes records about data, as well as documents and software. If all are modeled just with <code>dcat:Dataset</code>, it is not possible for users to restrict their search to the specific type of resource they are interested in.</li>
        <li> In addition to this, let's suppose that the catalog includes also records about Web-based services (e.g., a SPARQL endpoint or any of the services used for geospatial data): can a service be considered a "dataset"? how should it be modeled?</li>
      </ol>
          <p>These two scenarios are not hypothetical, but they reflect what is typically included, e.g., in catalogs following the [ISO-19115] or the [DataCite] standards, which model in different ways the documented resources, and both support records about services.</p>
        </p>
        <p class="existing_approaches">
          <p>[GeoDCAT-AP] provides a mechanism to model three out of the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://geo-ide.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php?title=ISO_19115_and_19115-2_CodeList_Dictionaries#MD_ScopeCode">more than 20 resource types</a> supported in [ISO-19115] - namely, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/ResourceType/dataset">dataset</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/ResourceType/series">dataset series</a>, and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/ResourceType/service">service</a>.</p>
          <p>The adopted approach is as follows:</p>
          <ul>
        <li> Datasets and dataset series are modeled with <code>dcat:Dataset</code>.</li>
        <li> The specific dataset "type" (dataset and dataset series) is denoted by using <code>dcterms:type</code> [DCTerms].</li>
        <li> Services are modeled as <code>dcat:Catalog</code>, in case of a catalog service, and with <code>dctype:Service</code> [DCTerms] in all the other cases.</li>
        <li> The type of service (discovery, download, view, etc.) is modeled by using <code>dcterms:type</code>.</li>
      </ul>
          <p>A similar approach has been adopted in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/CITnet/stash/projects/ODCKAN/repos/datacite-to-dcat-ap/">the study</a> carried out by the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/">European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC)</a> to map [DataCite] to [DCAT-AP]. </p>
          <p>The resource types supported in [DataCite] are 14. Most of them fall into the generic [VOCAB-DCAT] definition of "dataset", so they are modeled with <code>dcat:Dataset</code>. Moreover, the DCMI Type Vocabulary [DCTerms] is used to model both the dataset "type", and those resource types that cannot be modeled as datasets (events, physical objects, services).</p>

          <p>One of the key information necessary to correctly interprete geospatial data is the spatial coordinate reference system used. For instance, a coordinate reference system can denote the order in which the coordinates are specified (latitude / longitude, longitude / latitude), whether coordinates denote points, lines, surfaces, volumes, which is the unit of measurement used.</p>
          <p>This information is normally included in geospatial metadata since, depending on the coordinate reference system used, a dataset can or cannot be used for specific use cases. So, users can filter the relevant datasets during the discovery phase.</p>
          <p>Used more broadly, the notion of "reference system" can be applied to other data as well. For instance, suppose a dataset consisting of a set of measurements expressed as numbers. Are they percentages or quantities using a specific unit of measurement?</p>

        <li> The geographic area is denoted by a geographical name, possibly by using an identifier from a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazetteer">gazetteer</a> (e.g., Geonames) or a registry concerning, e.g., administrative units (see, e.g., the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenclature_of_Territorial_Units_for_Statistics">NUTS</a>).</li>
        <li> The geographic area is denoted by its "geometry", i.e., the geographic coordinates denoting its boundaries, its representative point (as its <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid">centroid</a>) or its <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_bounding_box">bounding box</a>.</li>
      </ol>
          <p>Geometries are typically used when it is necessary to denote an arbitrary geographic area, which may not correspond to a specific geographical name. Examples include (but are not limited to) satellite images and data from sensors. Geometries are also used in existing data catalogs for discovery and filtering purposes (e.g., this feature is supported in GeoNetwork and CKAN). Moreover, spatial queries are supported by the majority of the existing triple stores (including those not supporting [GeoSPARQL]).</p>
          <p>[VOCAB-DCAT] allows the specification of the spatial coverage of a dataset by using <code>dcterms:spatial</code> [DCTerms], and includes an example making use of an HTTP URI from Geonames denoting a geographical area.</p>
          <p>However, no guidance is provided on how to denote arbitrary regions with a "geometry" (i.e., a point, a bounding box, a polygon), which is the typical way spatial coverage is specified in geospatial metadata.</p>
          <p>The issue is particularly problematic since the existing vocabularies model this information in very different ways. Moreover, geometries can be expressed in a number of formats (e.g., [GML], <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text">WKT</a>, GeoJSON [RFC7946]). This situation makes it difficult to use information on spatial coverage effectively, e.g., to support spatial search and filtering.</p>
        </p>
        <p class="existing_approaches">
          <p>[SDWBP] provides a comprehensive guidance on how to specify geometries in the Best Practices under <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://w3c.github.io/sdw/bp/#geometry-and-crs">Section 12.2.2 <i>Geometries and coordinate reference systems</i></a>.</p>
          <p>As far as metadata are concerned, one of the documented approaches concerns the solution adopted in [GeoDCAT-AP], which models spatial coverage by using property <code>locn:geometry</code> [LOCN], and recommending encoding the geometry by using [GML] and/or [WKT] - see [SDWBP], <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#ex-geodcat-ap-bag-addresses">Example 15</a>:</p>

        <p class="description">
          <p>Cross-catalog harvesting is not a recent practice. Standard catalog services, as [OAI-PMH] and [CSW], have been designed to support this functionality. However, in the past, this was typically done across catalogs of homogeneous resources, usually pertaining to the same domain. </p>
          <p>This has changed in the last years, especially with the publication of cross-sector catalogs of government data. A notable example is the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://data.europa.eu/europeandataportal/">European Data Portal</a>, which harvests metadata from both cross-sector and thematic catalogs across EU Member States. In this scenario, one of the issues to be addressed is the heterogeneity of the metadata standards and harvesting protocols used across catalogs. </p>
          <p>A partial solution is provided by the development of harmonized mappings between metadata standards (see, e.g., the geospatial and statistical extensions to [DCAT-AP]), and by enabling catalog platforms, as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://geonetwork-opensource.org/">GeoNetwork</a>, to support multiple harvesting protocols and to map different metadata standards into their internal representation.</p>
          <p>An alternative approach is to enable catalogs to provide metadata in different profiles, using a standard harvesting protocol. Notably, standard protocols as [OAI-PMH] and [CSW] already support the possibility of serving records in different metadata schemas and serializations, by using specific query parameters. So, what is needed is an API-independent mechanism that can be used by clients with the existing catalog service protocols.</p>
          <p>HTTP content negotiation may be the most viable solution, since HTTP is the protocol Web-based catalog services makes use of. However, although the HTTP protocol would allow metadata to be served in different formats, it does not support the ability to negotiate the metadata profile.</p>
        </p>
        <p class="existing_approaches">
          <p>The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/CITnet/stash/projects/ODCKAN/repos/iso-19139-to-dcat-ap/browse/api">GeoDCAT-AP API</a> was designed to enable [CSW] endpoints to serve [ISO-19115] metadata based on the [GeoDCAT-AP] profile, by using the standard [CSW] interface - i.e., parameters <code>outputSchema</code> (for the metadata profile) and <code>outputFormat</code> (for the metadata format).</p>
          <p>HTTP content negotiation is supported to determine the returned metadata format, without the need of using parameter <code>outputSchema</code>. The ability to negotiate also the profile would enable a client to query a [CSW] endpoint without the need of knowing the supported harvesting protocol.</p>
          <p>Besides the resulting RDF serialisation of the source [ISO-19115] records, the API returns a set of HTTP <code>Link</code> headers, using the following <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/">relationship types</a>:</p>
          <ul>
        <li><code>derivedfrom</code>: The URL of the source document, containing the ISO 19139 records.</li>
        <li><code>profile</code>: The URI of the metadata schema used in the returned document.</li>
        <li><code>self</code>: The URL of the document returned by the API.</li>
        <li><code>alternate</code>: The URL of the current document, encoded in an alternative serialization.</li>
      </ul>
          <p>It is worth noting that, in its current definition, relationship type <code>alternate</code> denotes just a different serialization, and so it cannot be used to list the possibly alternative metadata schemas.</p>

Specific cases of relationships that I have come across:</p>
          <ul>
        <li> a dataset that contains multi-annual budget data (e.g. for a multi-annual programme) but also contains the data for individual years -- this could be as a spreadsheet with worksheets for each year and a sheet with the sum for the whole period</li>
        <li> two datasets that contain the same data but differ in other aspects than format, for example currency, measurement units, resolution, projection -- if we adopt an understanding that distributions of a dataset may only differ in format</li>

          <p>DCAT defines a Distribution as "Represents a specific available form of a dataset. Each dataset might be available in different forms, these forms might represent different formats of the dataset or different endpoints. Examples of distributions include a downloadable CSV file, an API or an RSS feed". It turns out that people read this differently. Main interpretations are that (a) the data in different Distributions of the same Dataset *only* differ in format, i.e the data contains the same data points in different representations and (b) the data in different Distributions might be related in other ways, for example by containing different data points for similar observations, as in the same kind of data for different years. </p>

          <p>The DCAT model contains a hierarchy of the main entities: a catalogue contains datasets and a dataset has associated distributions. This model does not contemplate a situation that datasets exist outside of a catalogue, while in practice datasets may be exposed on the Web as individual entities without description of a catalogue. 
Also, it may be inferred from the current model that a dataset, if it is defined as part of a catalogue, is part of only one catalogue; no consideration is given to the practice that datasets may be aggregated &#x2013; for example when the European Data Portal aggregates datasets from national data portals.</p>

          <p>In the context of W3C working and interest groups (e.g. SWIG, GLD, DWBP) several overlapping vocabularies have been developed for the description of datasets: DCAT, VoID and Data Cube. These vocabularies define similar concepts, but it is not entirely clear how these concepts are related. For example, all three vocabularies define a notion of &#x2018;dataset&#x2019; &#x2013; dcat:Dataset, void:Dataset and qb:DataSet. These notions are similar but not entirely equivalent.For example, it has been argued that void:Dataset and qb:DataSet are more like a dcat:Distribution than a dcat:Dataset.</p>

        <p class="description">
          <p>The metadata aggregated by Europeana is described using the Europeana Data Model (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://pro.europeana.eu/share-your-data/data-guidelines/edm-documentation">EDM</a>) which goal is to ensure interoperability between various cultural heritage data sources. EDM has been developed to be as re-usable as possible. It can be seen as an anchor to which various finer-grained models can be attached, ensuring their interoperability at a semantic level. The alignments done between EDM and other models such as CIDOC-CRM allow the definition of adequate application profiles that enable the transition from one model to another without hindering the interoperability of the data. 
Currently, Europeana itself maintains data in two flavours of EDM is being defined into two specific flavours, each with a specific XML Schema (for RDF/XML data): </p>
          <ul>
        <li> "EDM external":  The metadata aggregated by Europeana from its data providers is being validated against the EDM external XML schema prior to being loaded into the Europeana database.  </li>
        <li> "EDM internal": This schema is meant for validation and enrichment inside the Europeana ingestion workflow where data is reorganised to add "proxies" to distinguish provider data from Europeana data and certain properties are added to support the portal or the API. It is not meant to be used by data providers. The metadata complying with this schema is outputted via the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://labs.europeana.eu/api">Europeana APIs</a>.</li>
      </ul>
          <p>Both "external" and "internal" schemas are available at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/europeana/corelib/tree/master/corelib-solr-definitions/src/main/resources/eu">https://github.com/europeana/corelib/tree/master/corelib-solr-definitions/src/main/resources/eu</a></p>
          <p>Because XML can&#x2019;t capture all the constraints expressed in the EDM, an additional set of rules was defined using <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://schematron.com/spec.html">Schematron</a> and embedded in the XML schema. These technical choices impose limitations on the constraints that can be checked and a validation approach less suitable for Linked Data (XML imposes a document-centric approach). </p>
          <p>Europeana is not the only one designing and consuming different profiles of EDM in its ecosystem.</p>
          <ul>
        <li> The Digital Public Library of America has created its Metadata Application Profile (MAP), based on EDM</li>
        <li> Intermediate domain metadata aggregators have explored developing profiles of EDM that represent the specificity of their domain. One of the main motivation is that they can use these profiles to ingest, exploit and/or re-publish datasets with less data loss than if they would use the 'basic' EDM ingested by Europeana. Some Europeana data providers and aggregators have started to experiment with Semantic Web technologies to represent their own application profiles of EDM:<ul><li> Europeana Sounds</li><li> Digital Manuscripts to Europeana</li><li> Performing Arts</li><li> etc</li></ul></li>
      </ul>
          <p>Finally, some third party sources of interest (esp. authority data, thesauri, gazetteers) use models that are building blocks of EDM, like SKOS (i.e. EDM can itself be been as an application profile / extension of SKOS). Sometimes these sources publishes their data in different flavours at once (e.g <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://viaf.org">http://viaf.org</a>), which makes data consumption both easier (consumer can find the data elements it can consumer) and  more difficult (consumer has to separate elements of interests from irrelevant ones)</p>
          <p>Europeana has identified two types of AP: </p>
          <ul>
        <li> A refinement of EDM is any kind of specialisation of EDM to meet specific needs of the data provider, typically with specific constraints on the existing EDM elements).</li>
        <li> An extension to EDM is required when existing EDM classes and properties cannot represent the semantics of providers&#x2019; data with sufficient details.</li>
      </ul>
          <p>Currently data providers who would like to provide their data to Europeana using their profiles are unable to do it, even when these profiles would be 'compatible' with the Europeana one for ingestion (which typically happens in the case of a basic EDM extension that adds fields on top of the Europeana profile). This is chiefly because of XML rigidities: Europeana ingestion expects a reference to only one profile/schema. It will not recognize profiles that are compatible with it.</p>

          <p>A prerequisite of communicating, annotating or linking a dataset (or a defined part of it) is 
its unambiguous identification. Since a dataset and its distributions might evolve over time the 
identification method has to take into account their versioning. The respective distributions
might significantly differ in terms of media type and further serialization properties and 
should therefore have distinct identifiers. </p>
        </p>
        <p class="existing_approaches">
          <p>While DCAT currently does not support resource versioning, subsets (slices) and derivations 
of a Dataset might be specified as separate, related Dataset instances. 
Each one is exposed by a set of dedicated Distribution resources identified by a resolvable URI. 
These Distribution URIs are used to refer to a particular materialization of the (abstract) Dataset. 
Their design preferably follows the RESTful URI naming conventions. 
Referencing Distribution metadata has the benefit of providing access to related properties, 
e.g. usage restrictions and licensing. 
Contrary, when there are multiple independent copies of Dataset's metadata 
across Catalogs this method suffers from generating alternative identifiers 
for the same resource (i.e. the same access/download target).</p>

				Many of the functions needed for a profile are also ones that will be targeted by validation routines,
				such as cardinality of properties, valid values, etc. To define these redundantly in profiles and in
				validation routines risks the creation of contradictory rules relating to the profile.
			  </p>
			  <p>
				There needs to be a way to coordinate the profile and the validation function. This could be a matter
				of basing the profile on a defined validation language (SHACL or ShEx or Schematron...), or of deriving
				the validation rules from the profile. Note, though, that the existing validation languages are quite
				atomistic and so far there has not been a demonstration of creating a usable profile from a validation language.
				In any case, the relationship between these two related languages needs to be clarified.
