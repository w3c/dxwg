# Profile Descriptor Ontology
This component of the [Data Exchange Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/)'s code repository is for work on the *Profile Descriptor* task.

## Profiles Description Ontology
Currently (June, 2018), an ontology to describe objects relevant to profiling (original specifications profiled, profiles of profiles, categorisation of profiling methods, validation resources etc.) has been created. See:

* [Profiledesc Documentation](https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/profiledesc/) - ontology description as a web page (HTML)
* [profiledesc.ttl](profiledesc.ttl) - ontology source (RDF, turtle)
* [profiledesc.png](profiledesc.png) - ontology overview diagram

### Examples
The [examples](examples/) folder contains a series of scenarios of the Profiles Description Ontology being used to model existing and likely future profiling situations.

## Next Steps
As of June, 2018, DXWG is considering delivering Best Practice guidance on profiling and profile negotiation as well as perhaps multiple system/protocol-specific implementations of profile negotiation. ProfileDesc may be one such implementation.
