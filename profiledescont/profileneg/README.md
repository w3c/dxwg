# Profile negotiation - proposal

*This proposal relates previous, unstandardised, work that partly deals with [Profile negotiation [RPFN] #74](https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/74) and attempted to make human- and machine-readable lists of profiles available for resources and provides a simple mechanism to access them. This also addressed [Requirement, 6.8.4 Profiles listing [RPFL]](https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/73) but was not widely implemented as a standard method.*

There is a convention implemented by some Linked Data platforms to provide access to different model *views* of a resource by use of the query string argument `_view` and for MIME type selection by use of `_format` that may be in addition to regular HTTP Accept Header MIME format requests. This allows the following:

URI | Description of dereferencing
----|-----------------------------
`http://example.org/dataset/ds1` | Base URI of a resource giving default model view and MIME type (format)
`http://example.org/dataset/ds1` + **?_view=dcat** | The "DCAT" view of the resource, default MIME type
`http://example.org/dataset/ds1` + **?_view=dcat&_format=text/turtle** (or perhaps _format=turtle or _format=ttl) | The "DCAT" view of the resource, serialised in turtle

### Informal modelling
Informally we may say that:

* each resource must have 1+ *views*
* each view must have 1+ *formats* (MIME types)
* if not specified, a default view and format are given

## Alternates View
The convention requires a special view, the *alternates* view, to be given that lists all other views: `http://example.org/dataset/ds1` + **?_view=alternates**.

One currently implemented system using an *Alternates View* like this showing the delivery of metadata according to Semantic Web ontologies and also legacy XML formats as well as HTML web pages can be seen for the Geoscience Australia Samples Register's samples:

<http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/sample/AU239?_view=alternates>

### Informal modelling
The information contained in the alternates view, at least as per the above implementation, can be informally modelled as:

* each *view* has a *token*
  * used to create a query string to access it, viz. `{RESOURCE_URI}?_view={TOKEN}`
* each view has a `label` and a `comment`
* each view *may* have a *namespace* (URI) indicated
* each view must have 1+ MIME type expressed as per strings as per [Mozilla's incomplete list of them](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Complete_list_of_MIME_types)

### Example
In another implementation for the Australian Government's test Government Organisations Register (<http://test.linked.data.gov.au/dataset/auorg>), the *alternates view* of an Organisation resource lists an *AU Org*, a *dirgov* and an *alternates* view for each Organisation. This, for a particular organisation, `B-02210`, is modelled as per Listing 1 & Figure 1 below.

## Proposal to use profiledesc
We propose to model the contents of the Alternates View of objects using this Profiles Description Ontology. For the example in Listing 1 & Figure 1, the modelling could be as per Figure 2 below.

### Benefits
Currently, there is no formal model to inform a machine of the different model views and formats available for a resource. We believe it straightforward to use the Profiles Description Ontology as outlined in Figure 2 above. Basic human-readable descriptions of model view and formats are directly catered for using the properties already suggested for use in the Ontology and the descriptions of the specifications to which various views conform is handled better: whereas in the current alternates view, a *namespace* is indicated for a view, using ProfDesc, a view can be much better described using a `Profile` (or a `Base Specification`) and an `Implementation Resource Descriptor` and all the standard ProfDesc constructs.

## Proposal to allow browser profile negotiation
In addition, we propose to indicate how to negotiate profile information within the web browser, as requested in the proposed Use Case [web browser navigation of profile information](https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/239) in some manner like the implementation described above. Details of this proposal are not given yet until further work with Lars & Ruben on harmonising approaches with the HTTP Accept-Profile and Profile headers is undertaken.
