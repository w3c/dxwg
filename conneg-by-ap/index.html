      This document describes how Internet clients may negotiate for content provided by servers according to
      <em>profiles</em>. This is distinct from negotiating by Media Type or Language: the <em>profile</em> is expected
      to specify the content of information returned, which may be a subset of what the responding server contains.

      For details about what a <em>profile</em> is, see the [[PROF-GUIDE]] recommendation published by the producers
      of this document.

  <section id="introduction" class="informative">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Content delivered by dereferencing Internet identifiers has long been able to be negotiated for in different
      ways. When using the HTTP protocol [[RFC7230]], a client may set an <code>Accept</code> header specifying
      preferred Media Types which the server may or may not supply. Thus, resources available in different languages
      may be requested by setting an HTTP <code>Accept-Language</code> header. Until now, clients have not had a
      defined way to negotiate for content based on its adherence to an information model - a standard, a specification or
      a <a>profile</a> - and this document addresses this functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      When online information about a resource adheres to one or more profiles, methods described here allow
      clients to list those profiles and request content according to one or more of them in order of preference.
      For example, information about an online book might adhere to the Dublin Core Terms [[DCTERMS]] metadata
      specification with each field of information, such as <em>title</em>, <em>description</em>, <em>author</em> etc.,
      being defined and formatted according to various Dublin Core elements (<code>dct:title</code>,
      <code>dct:description</code> &amp; <code>dct:creator</code>, respectively). Then, a request for the informatoin about this
      book may ask for the list of profiles according to which the metadata is available, or it may ask specifically for a response adhering to the
      Dublin Core Terms profile. When a non-existent or unsupported profile is requested, a server returns default content.
    </p>
    <p>
      When selecting a content negotiation mechanism, an Internet client may use the HTTP protocol but it may also use
      other methods for providing instructions to a server, such as URI Query String Arguments (QSAs). QSAs are long
      established as useful for humans and machines for situations where negotiation via HTTP is not practical, such
      as when manually entering requests into web browsers. This document also provides guidance for both HTTP and non-HTTP methods
      of content negotiation and ensures they all adhere to a single functional specification, and thus their functional equivalency.

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      In many cases, there are several ways to describe a resource within the scope of a single Media Type.
      For instance, XML documents, while conforming to the <code>text/xml</code> Media Type, may adhere to one of
      several DTDs or XML Schemas. RDF documents, with a choice of Media Type serializations such as
      <code>text/turtle</code>, <code>application/rdf+xml</code> and others, have a very large number of vocabularies
      (classes and properties) available to use for their content's information model. When a client initiates a request
      for an Internet resource, e.g., an HTTP GET to retrieve a resource or an HTTP PUT to create or replace a resource, neither the
      client nor the server have yet had any standardized way to exchange information on how the transmitted resource
      will be structured precisely according to DTDs, XML Schema, vocabularies or other standards, specifications or
      <em>profiles</em>. When using non-HTTP content negotiation, other methods, such as URIs with Query String
      Arguments, no universal or standardized method for doing this has been established although there are multiple
      specific ways this has been implemented previously, such as the OAI-PMH protocol [[OAI-PMH]].
    </p>
    <p>
      This document describes content negotiation based on profiles using HTTP protocol by introducing new headers and
      non-HTTP methods, such as via QSAs, by introducing a general QSA Application Programming Interface (API).

    <h2>Abstract Model</h2>
    <p>
      This section describes an abstract conceptual model for content negotiation by profile, independent of any
      specific implementation - here termed realizations.
    </p>
    <section id="abstractmodelcontext">
      <h3>Context</h3>
      <p>
        All content negotiation takes place between a <a>client</a> and a <a>server</a> over the Internet with the
        former requesting a representation of a <a>resource</a> or <em>resource</em>'s <em>metadata</em> through a
        <em>request</em> and receiving it via a <em>response</em>. In some cases, a <em>server</em> may have to make a 
        <em>request</em> of a <em>client</em> and receive a <em>response</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        An Internet <em>resource</em> may have many aspects over which a <em>client</em>/<em>server</em> pair of
        agents might negotiate for content. These aspects are to be treated independently so content negotiation for a 
        resource involving negotiation by profile and potentially multiple other aspects of a resource will not affect
        each other. For this reason, other than a directive to maintain independence, no further discussion of 
        negotiation by profile and the relations to other forms of negotiation are given. Specific realizations might
        require special handling of profile and other forms of negotiation.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <em>client</em> <em>request</em>ing the representation of a <em>resource</em> conforming to a <em>profile</em>
        MUST identify the <em>resource</em> by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [[RFC3986]] and MUST
        identify a <em>profile</em> either by a URI or a <em>token</em> that unambiguously identifies the
        <em>profile</em> for the <em>server</em> within that <em>request</em>/<em>response</em> session.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this abstract model, we don't assume any specifics about <em>client</em>, <em>server</em>, <em>resource</em>,
        <em>metadata</em>, <em>request</em> or <em>response</em>.

      <h3>Requests and Responses</h3>
      <p>
        There are two main types of <em>request</em> that a <em>client</em> might make of a <em>server</em> regarding
        content negotiation by profile. A <em>client</em> wishing to negotiate for content via profile adhering to this
        specification MUST be able to implement these two request types.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>list profiles</strong><br />
          a <em>client</em> requests the list of URIs for <em>profile</em>s a <em>server</em> is able to deliver
          <em>resource</em> representations conforming to
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>get resource by profile</strong>
          <br />a <em>client</em> requests a representation of the requested <em>resource</em> represented conforming
          to a particular <em>profile</em>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        A third <em>request</em> type is given that is expected not to apply to all realizations of this abstract model
        and not all clients adhering to this specification need implement it.
      </p>
      <ol start="3">
        <li>
          <strong>list profiles tokens</strong><br />
          a <em>client</em> requests the list of <em>token</em>s the <em>server</em> uses for <em>profile</em>s a
          <em>server</em> is able to deliver <em>resource</em> representations conforming to and their mapping to
          <em>profile</em> URIs
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        A <em>server</em> adhering to this specification MUST respond to each request with the following
        <em>response</em>s. The first two types are required, handling the third depends on the realization environment.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>list profiles</strong><br />
          a <em>server</em> responds to a <em>client</em> with the list of <em>profile</em> URIs for the <em>profile</em>s it is able to
          deliver <em>resource</em> representations conforming to
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>get resource by profile</strong><br />
          a <em>server</em> responds with either a specific <em>profile</em> for a <em>resource</em> conforming to a
          requested <em>profile</em> identified by the <em>client</em> or a default <em>profile</em>

          a <em>server</em> responds the list of <em>profile </em> <em>token</em>s it is able to deliver
          <em>resource</em> representations conforming to and their mapping to <em>profile</em> URIs.

      <section id="listprofiles">
        <h4>list profiles</h4>
        <p>
          A <em>client</em> wishes to know what <em>profile</em>s a <em>server</em> is able to deliver conformant
          representations of a <em>resource</em> for. This may need to be known either before a <em>request</em> for a 
          particular <em>resource</em> representation is made or perhaps after an initial <em>request</em> for a
          <em>resource</em> representation is made.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>list profiles</strong> <em>request</em> MAY be an independent request or part of another 
          realization's request.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>list profiles</strong> <em>request</em> MAY result in a <em>response</em> in one of a
          number of structures or formats provided the <em>profile</em>s representations of a <em>resource</em>
          conforming to are unambiguously identified either by URI or a <em>token</em> mappable to a URI.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <em>server</em> MUST NOT list <em>profile</em>s which <em>resource</em> representations conform to if
          it is unable to deliver those representations when presented with a <strong>get resource by profile</strong>
          <em>request</em>.

      <section id="getresourcebyprofile">
        <h4>get resource by profile</h4>
        <p>
          The most basic <em>request</em> of content negotiation by profile is for a <em>client</em> to <em>request</em>
          a representation of a <em>resource</em> that is claimed to conform to a <em>profile</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <em>client</em> executing a <strong>get resource by profile</strong> <em>request</em> MUST
          identify the <em>profile</em> with either a URI or a token mappable to a URI.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <em>client</em> executing a <strong>get resource by profile</strong> MAY <em>request</em> a

          deterministically map that token to a <em>profile</em>'s URI. This is due to the known requirement for
          <em>profile</em>s to be able to be referred to within other URIs, such as those of <em>resources</em> and other
          situations where referring to the <em>profile</em> itself by a URI is not possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <em>server</em> responding to a <strong>list profiles tokens</strong> <em>request</em> MUST provide
          token/URI mappings that list tokens and URIs, either of which can be used for <strong>get resource by

      <p>
        A realization of the Abstract Model using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is presented here.
        This implementation is based on HTTP content negotiation and uses two new HTTP headers,
	      <code>Accept-Profile</code> and <code>Content-Profile</code>
	      that are to be defined in an upcoming Internet-Draft [[PROF-IETF]].
      </p>
      <p>
        Content negotiation by profile adds a further dimension to the already existing HTTP content
        negotiation dimensions, namely media type (<code>Accept</code>/<code>Content-Type</code>), encoding
        (<code>Accept-Encoding</code>/<code>Content-Encoding</code>) and language
        (<code>Accept-Language</code>/<code>Content-Language</code>).

	    <p>
	  	The first one is to issue an <code>OPTIONS</code> request against the resource.

	</section>
	<section id="listprofilehttplink">
		<h4>Using a <code>HTTP Link</code> header field</h4>
        <p>
          The second way is to issue an <code>GET</code> or <code>HEAD</code> against the resource. In this 
          case a server implementing
          content negotiation by profile SHOULD return a HTTP <code>Link</code> header containing information about the
          default representation of that resource (i. e. the representation that will be returned after any
          content negotiation has been performed) and information about any alternate representations of that
          resource. The returned representation will be identified by <code>rel="self"</code>, other representations by
          <code>rel="alternate"</code>.
        </p>
        <p>As an example, consider the resource <code>http://example.org/a/resource</code>  available
          in the media types <code>application/xml</code>, <code>text/html</code> and <code>text/turtle</code>.
          The <code>text/html</code> representation has
          no profile, whereas the <code>application/xml</code> and <code>text/turtle</code> representations are
          both available in the profiles <code>urn:example:profile:1</code> and <code>urn:example:profile:2</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          All representations of <code>/a/resource</code> have own content-location URLs which leaves us with the following matrix:
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr><th>Media type / profile</th><th>urn:example:profile:1</th><th>urn:example:profile:2</th></tr>
          <tr><th>text/html</th><td>http://example.org/a/resource.html</td><td>http://example.org/a/resource.html</td></tr>
          <tr><th>text/turtle</th><td>http://example.org/a/resource.prof1.ttl</td><td>http://example.org/a/resource.prof2.ttl</td></tr>
          <tr><th>application/xml</th><td>http://example.org/a/resource.prof1.xml</td><td>http://example.org/a/resource.prof2.xml</td></tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          Assuming that a request without an <code>Accept-Profile</code> header per default delivers content conforming to
          <code>urn:example:profile:1</code> a request/response pair would look as follows:

      <h2>Query String Arguments</h2>
	    <div class="issue" data-number="511"></div>
      <div class="issue" data-number="538"></div>
      <p>
	      A Query String Argument (QSA) realization of the <a href="#abstractmodel">Abstract Model</a>
	      is presented here. Unlike the HTTP realization,
 		which is the subject of an independent document [[PROF-IETF]],
	      this realization is fully specified here
	      and this document is considered normative for the QSA realization.
	      This realization does not preclude other QSA specifications for profile and content negotiation.
      </p>
      <p>
        A query string is a part of a URI which assigns values to specified parameters. QSAs are commonly used within
        web browsers by humans and in other <em>client</em>/<em>server</em> situations to deliver extra information to a
        <em>server</em>.
      </p>
      <p><strong><em>Key naming</em></strong></p>
      <p>
        When content negotiation by profile is to take place using QSAs, the <em>request</em>s and <em>response</em>s
        of the <a href="#abstractmodel">Abstract Model</a> MUST be implemented.
	      However there is some flexibility in how this may be done:
	      QSA key/value pairs must be implemented but the specific key terms may be changed.
	      In this realization, <code>_profile</code> and <code>_mediatype</code> are used
	      to indicate a single or a list of
        preference-ordered profiles or Media types respectively with profiles or Media Types indicated by either URI or
        token.
      </p>
      <div class="note" title="Current use of tokens for negotiation by Media Type">
        <p>
          Currently, the convention in HTTP content negotiation by media type uses tokens for Media Types, such as
          <code>text/html</code> or <code>application/ld+json</code> with the tokens registered at
          <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types">IANA's Media Types list</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no proposal yet to create a central register of profiles as this is thought by the authors to be
          un-sustainable in the long-term, given the likely numbers of profiles to be established.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this reason, the QSA realization allows either URIs or tokens for profiles to be used and it is expected,
          though not mandated here, that QSA realizations will also allow URIs or tokens for Media Types and other
          content negotiation dimensions, such as language. There are already several initiatives that have created URIs
          for Media Types based on the IANA register's tokens.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p><strong><em>Resource URI</em></strong></p>
      <p>
        Resource URIs for which QSA-based profile negotiation is taking place MUST NOT themselves be QSA values
        of other resource URIs in any QSA-based realization. Such mechanics may be used but must be transparent to the
        realization's <em>client</em> applications.

        </p>
        <p>
          The QSA key/value pair <code>_profile=list</code> SHOULD be used however the <em>server</em> MAY

          implement a similar function using QSA key/value pairs such as <code>_view=alternates</code>.

        <p>
          The complete request for the <em>profile</em>s to which a <em>resource</em>'s representations conform can be

          requested
        </p>
        <p>
          A <em>client</em> making this <em>request</em> MAY negotiate for particular formats of the response by
          using a QSA equivalent to the HTTP <code>Accept</code> header to indicate a Media Type. A <em>server</em>
          SHOULD implement a <code>_mediatype</code> QSA for this but MAY implement an alternative, such
          as <code>_format</code> as long as this is dicoverable,

        <p><strong><em>Expressing profile preference</em></strong></p>
        <p>
          A <em>server</em> implementing <em>profile</em> listing for <em>resource</em>s SHOULD allow the
          requester to indicate preferences. This SHOULD be done by allowing the QSA indicating the desired
          profile, usually <code>_profile</code>, to have a comma-separated list as its value so, for a
          <em>client</em> desiring representations of <code>/a/resource</code> according to profiles with tokens
          <code>aaa</code>, <code>bbb</code> &amp; <code>ccc</code> we have:
        </p>
        <pre class="example nohighlight" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite" title="Requesting a list of profiles for a resource by QSA in HTML">
  GET /a/resource?_profile=aaa,bbb,ccc HTTP/1.1
        </pre>
        <p>
          Servers MAY support any combination of profile URIs or tokens for this
		(e.g. <code>aaa,http://example.org/profile-x,bbb</code>).
		However, in this situation, profile URIs containing commas must escape them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, a <em>server</em> implementing multiple Media Type return formats for <em>profile</em> listing SHOULD
          allow a client to specify a preference order for Media Types and also for other dimensions of content
          negotiation, such as language. When using a QSA-only API, Media Type preferences (and language and others in a
          similar fashion) MAY be specified in a comma-separated list form, most preferred to least such that

    <h2>Security and Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The use of HTTP to negotiate and transport implies that all privacy and security issues
      that are relevant for that protocol are also relevant for profile negotiation. E. g.,
      information such as user agent, accept-headers, IP address etc. can potentially be used as
      identifying information, and particularly, the IP address adds information about geolocation
      and institutional membership. Apart from that, there are no known security or privacy impacts
      of this feature.

          This requirement is addressed by suggesting how an Internet resource in general, rather than specifically a
          <code>dcat:Dataset</code> or <code>dcat:Distribution</code> should list profiles it implements. A DCAT-
          specific solution should not be any different from the general case.

          This requirement is taken to mean "create a way to list the profiles implemented by a Internet resource for

            <ul>
              <li>see [[PROF-GUIDE]]</li>
              <li>an approach suggested is to provide an <em>alternate view</em> resource for the original
                resource located at <code>RESOURCE_URI + ?_view=alternates</code> which lists, at a minimum, the
                <em>profiles</em>, <em>media types</em> (formats) &amp; <em>languages</em> available, as per the
                <em>alternate views</em> guidance.
