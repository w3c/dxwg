	<p>DCAT is an RDF vocabulary designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogs published on the Web. This document defines the schema and provides examples for its use.</p>
  <p>By using DCAT to describe datasets in data catalogs, publishers are using a standard model and vocabulary that facilitates the consumption and aggregation of metadata from multiple catalogs,
		and in doing so can increase the discoverability of datasets. It also makes it possible to have a decentralized approach to publishing data catalogs and makes federated search for datasets across catalogs in multiple sites possible using the same query mechanism and structure. Aggregated DCAT metadata can serve as a manifest file as part of the digital preservation process.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">The namespace for DCAT terms is <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#</code></p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">The suggested prefix for the DCAT namespace is <code>dcat</code></p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">The (revised) DCAT vocabulary is available <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/dxwg/dcat-build-test-daveb/dcat/rdf/dcat.ttl">here</a>.</p>

	<h3>DCAT history</h3>
	<p>The original DCAT vocabulary (originally hosted at http://vocab.deri.ie/dcat) was developed at the Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI), refined by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/egov/">eGov Interest Group</a>, and then finally standardized in 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/gld/">Government Linked Data (GLD)</a> Working Group.</p>
	<p>This revised version of DCAT was developed by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/">Dataset Exchange Working Group</a> in response to a new set of Use Cases and Requirements [[DCAT-UCR]] submitted on the basis of experience with the DCAT vocabulary from the time of the original version, and new applications not originally considered. A summary of the changes from  [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] can be found at <a href="#changes">Change History</a></p>

	<h3>External terms</h3>
  <p>DCAT incorporates terms from pre-existing vocabularies where stable terms with appropriate meanings could be found, such as foaf:homepage and dct:title.  Informal summary definitions of the externally-defined terms are included here for convenience, while authoritative definitions are available in the normative references.  Changes to definitions in the references, if any, supersede the summaries given in this specification.  Note that conformance to DCAT (Section 4) concerns usage of only the terms in the DCAT namespace itself, so possible changes to the external definitions will not affect the conformance of DCAT implementations.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p class="note">From DCAT 2014 [[!VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]]</p>

<p>Data can come in many formats, ranging from spreadsheets, through XML and RDF, to various speciality formats. DCAT does not make any assumptions about the serialisation format of the datasets described in a catalog. Other, complementary vocabularies <em title="MAY" class="rfc2119">MAY</em> be used together with DCAT to provide more detailed format-specific information. For example, properties from the VoID vocabulary [[VOID]] can be used to express various statistics about a DCAT-described dataset if that dataset is in RDF format.</p>
<p>This document does not prescribe any particular method of deploying data expressed in DCAT. DCAT is applicable in many contexts including RDF accessible via SPARQL endpoints, embedded in HTML pages as RDFa, or serialized as e.g. RDF/XML or Turtle. The examples in this document use Turtle simply because of Turtle's readability.</p>
</section>

<section id="motivation" class="informative"><h2>Motivation for change</h2>
<p>The original Recommendation [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]], published in January 2014, provided the basic framework for describing datasets. Importantly, it made the distinction between a dataset as an abstract idea and a distribution as a manifestation of the dataset. Although DCAT has been widely adopted, it has became clear that the original specification lacked a number of essential features that were added either through application profiles, such as the European Commission's DCAT-AP [[DCAT-AP]], or the development of larger vocabularies that, to a greater or lesser extent, built upon the base standard, such as the Healthcare and Life Sciences Community Profile [[HCLS-Dataset]], the Data Tag Suite [[DATS]] and more. This version of DCAT has been developed to address the specific shortcomings that have come to light through the experiences of different communities, the aim being, of course, to improve interoperability between the outputs of these larger vocabularies.</p>
<p>This draft includes re-writing of the specification throughout. Significant changes from the 2014 Recommendation are marked within the text using "Note" sections, as well as being described in the <a href="#changes">Change History</a>.</p>

</section>

<section id="namespaces-1">

<h2 >Namespaces</h2>

<p>The namespace for DCAT is <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#</code>.
	However, it can be noted that DCAT makes extensive use of terms from other vocabularies, in particular Dublin Core [[DCTERMS]].
	DCAT itself defines a minimal set of classes and properties of its own.
  A full set of namespaces and prefixes used in this document is shown in the table below.</p>

<section id="conformance">

<p class="note">Modified from DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]]</p>

<p>A data catalog conforms to DCAT if:</p>
<ul>
	<li> Access to data is organized into datasets, distributions, and data-services. </li>
	<li> An RDF description of the catalog itself and its datasets, distributions, and data-services is available (but the choice of
RDF syntaxes, access protocols, and access policies is not mandated by this specification).</li>
	<li> The contents of all metadata fields that are held in the catalog, and that contain data about the catalog itself and its datasets, distributions, and data-services, are included in this RDF description, expressed using the appropriate classes and properties from DCAT, except where no such class or property exists.</li>
	<li> All classes and properties defined in DCAT are used in a way consistent with the semantics declared in this specification.</li>
	<li>DCAT-compliant catalogs <em title="MAY" class="rfc2119">MAY</em> include additional non-DCAT metadata fields and additional RDF data in the catalog's RDF description.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	A <strong>DCAT profile</strong> is a specification for data catalogs that adds additional constraints to DCAT. A data catalog that conforms to the profile also conforms to DCAT. Additional constraints in a profile <em title="MAY" class="rfc2119">MAY</em> include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li> Cardinality constraints, including a minimum set of required metadata fields </li>
	<li> Sub-classes and sub-properties of the standard DCAT classes and properties</li>
	<li> Classes and properties for additional metadata fields not covered in DCAT</li>
	<li> Controlled vocabularies or URI sets as acceptable values for properties</li>
	<li> Requirements for specific access mechanisms (RDF syntaxes, protocols) to the catalog's RDF description</li>

<h2>Vocabulary overview</h2>

<p class="note">Significantly extended from DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]]</p>

<p>DCAT is an RDF vocabulary well-suited to representing data catalogs such as <a href="https://www.data.gov/">data.gov</a> and <a href="https://data.gov.uk">data.gov.uk</a>. DCAT defines eight main classes:</p>
<ul>
	<li> <code><a href="#Class:Catalog">dcat:Catalog</a></code> represents the catalog</li>
	<li> <code><a href="#Class:Resource">dcat:Resource</a></code> represents an item in a catalog.</li>
	<li> <code><a href="#Class:Dataset">dcat:Dataset</a></code> represents a dataset in a catalog.</li>
	<li> <code><a href="#Class:Distribution">dcat:Distribution</a></code> represents an accessible form or representation of a dataset as for example a downloadable file.</li>
	<li> <code><a href="#Class:Data_Service">dcat:DataService</a></code> represents a data service in a catalog.</li>
	<li> <code><a href="#Class:Data_Distribution_Service">dcat:DataDistributionService</a></code> represents a service that provides access to distributions of datasets and extracts of datasets.</li>
<!--	<li> (<code><a href="#Class:DataTransformationService">dcat:DataTransformationService</a></code> represents a service that can transform a dataset, e.g. spatial coordinate transformation; interpolation or resampling of a dataset).</li> -->
	<li> <code><a href="#Class:Discovery_Service">dcat:DiscoveryService</a></code> represents a service that supports discovery functions.</li>
	<li> <code><a href="#Class:Catalog_Record">dcat:CatalogRecord</a></code> describes a dataset entry in the catalog, primarily concerning the registration information such as who added the item and when</li>
</ul>

	</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="note">
	Along with the rest of the <a href="#vocabulary-overview">Vocabulary overview</a>, this diagram is <b>non-normative</b>.
	Furthermore, while the diagram uses UML-style class notation, it should be interpreted following the usual RDF open-world assumptions around the presence/absence of properties, relationships, and their cardinality.
	The properties shown in each class reflect those recommended in the descriptions of classes in the <a href="#vocabulary-specification">Vocabulary specification</a>.
	To assist in understanding the full scope of each class, properties are copied down from each '::super-class'.
	Cardinalities are shown in a few places to reinforce expectations, but these are not axiomatized or enforced in any way by this recommendation.
</p>

<p>
A <b>dataset</b> in DCAT is defined as a "collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more formats".
A dataset is a conceptual entity, and can be represented by one or more <b>distributions</b> that serialize the dataset for transfer.
Distributions of a dataset can be provided via <b>data distribution services</b>.
Detailed properties for a data distribution service API are out of the scope of this version of DCAT. </p>

<p>Datasets and <b>data services</b>, and potentially other types of thing, <em title="MAY" class="rfc2119">MAY</em> be included in a <b>catalog</b>.
Types of data service that might be found in a catalog include data distribution services, <b>discovery services</b> such as portals and catalog services, <b>data transformation services</b> such as coordinate transformation services, re-sampling and interpolation services, and various <b>data processing services</b>.
</p>

<div class="note">
	<p>
	The scope of DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] was limited to catalogs of datasets.
	A number of use cases for the revision involve also having <b>data distribution services</b> as members of a catalog - see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#ID6">DCAT Distribution to describe web services - ID6</a> and
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#ID18">Modeling service-based data access - ID18</a>.
It has been decided to add an explicit class for Data Distribution Services in this revision of DCAT, and to enable these to be part of a Catalog.
Provision for other data services to also be part of a Catalog will also be made, as well as for Catalogs to be composed of other Catalogs.
See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">Issue #172</a>. </p>
<p>
	 The wiki page on <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/wiki/Cataloguing-data-services">Cataloguing data services</a> describes some proposals related to this requirement.
</p>
</div>

<p>A <b>CatalogRecord</b> describes an entry in the catalog. Notice that while <code>dcat:Resource</code> represents the dataset or service itself, <code>dcat:CatalogRecord</code> is the record that describes the registration of an item in the catalog. The use of <code>dcat:CatalogRecord</code> is considered optional. It is used to capture provenance information about entries in a catalog. If this distinction is not necessary then <code>dcat:CatalogRecord</code> can be safely ignored.</p>


<p id="blankNodes">RDF allows resources to have global identifiers (IRIs) or to be blank nodes.  Blank nodes can be used to denote resources without explicitly naming them with an IRI. They can appear in the subject and object position of a triple [[rdf11-primer]].
While blank nodes may offer flexibility for some use cases, in a Linked Data context, blank nodes limit our ability to collaboratively annotate data. A  blank node resource cannot be the target of a link and it can't be annotated with new information from new sources. As one of the biggest benefits of the Linked Data approach is that "anyone can say anything anywhere", use of blank nodes undermines some of the advantages we can gain from wide adoption of the RDF model. Even within the closed world of a single application dataset, use of blank nodes can quickly become limiting when integrating new data [[LinkedDataPatterns]]. 
For these reasons, instances of the DCAT main classes <em title="SHOULD" class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> have a global identifier, and use of blank nodes is generally discouraged when encoding DCAT in RDF.</p>

<p class="note">All RDF examples in this document are written in Turtle syntax [[Turtle]] and many are available from the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/tree/dcat-build-test-daveb/dcat/examples">DXWG code repository</a>. </p>
<p class="note">Each RDF example in this document is intended to demonstrate specific capabilities of DCAT, and therefore only shows a subset of all the potential properties and links which might appear in a complete DCAT resource. </p>

<section id="basic-example">
<h3>Basic Example</h3>
<p>This example provides a quick overview of how DCAT might be used to represent a government catalog and its datasets. </p>

<p>First, the catalog description:
</p>
<pre>  &nbsp;:catalog
       a dcat:Catalog&nbsp;;
       dct:title "Imaginary Catalog"&nbsp;;
       rdfs:label "Imaginary Catalog"&nbsp;;
       foaf:homepage &lt;http://example.org/catalog&gt;&nbsp;;
       dct:publisher&nbsp;:transparency-office&nbsp;;
       dct:language &lt;http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-1/en&gt; &nbsp;;
       dcat:dataset&nbsp;:dataset-001&nbsp; , :dataset-002 , :dataset-003 ;
       .
</pre>
<p>The publisher of the catalog has the relative URI&nbsp;:transparency-office. Further description of the publisher can be provided as in the following example:
</p>
<pre>  &nbsp;:transparency-office
       a foaf:Organization&nbsp;;
       rdfs:label "Transparency Office"&nbsp;;
       .
</pre>
<p>The catalog lists each of its datasets via the dcat:dataset property. In the example above, an example dataset was mentioned with the relative URI&nbsp;:dataset-001. A possible description of it using DCAT is shown below:
</p>
<pre>  &nbsp;:dataset-001
       a dcat:Dataset&nbsp;;
       dct:title "Imaginary dataset"&nbsp;;
       dcat:keyword "accountability","transparency" ,"payments"&nbsp;;
	   dct:creator&nbsp;:finance-employee-001&nbsp;;
       dct:issued "2011-12-05"^^xsd:date&nbsp;;
       dct:modified "2011-12-05"^^xsd:date&nbsp;;
       dcat:contactPoint &lt;http://example.org/transparency-office/contact&gt; ;
       dct:temporal &lt;http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/quarter/2006-Q1&gt; ;
       dct:spatial &lt;http://www.geonames.org/6695072&gt; ;
       dct:publisher&nbsp;:finance-ministry&nbsp;;
       dct:language &lt;http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-1/en&gt; &nbsp;;
       dct:accrualPeriodicity &lt;http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx/2009/code#freq-W&gt; &nbsp;;
       dcat:distribution&nbsp;:dataset-001-csv&nbsp;;
       .
</pre>

<p>In order to express the frequency of update in the example above, we chose to use an instance from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/#dsd-cog">Content-Oriented Guidelines</a> developed as part
of the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Data Cube Vocabulary [[VOCAB-DATA-CUBE]] efforts. Additionally, we chose to describe the spatial and temporal coverage of the example dataset using URIs from <a href="http://www.geonames.org/">Geonames</a> and the Interval dataset (originally available from http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/interval) from data.gov.uk, respectively. A contact point is also provided where comments and feedback about the dataset can be sent. Further details about the contact point, such as email address or telephone number, can be provided using vCard [[VCARD-RDF]].</p>

<p>The dataset distribution :dataset-001-csv can be downloaded as a 5Kb CSV file. This information is
represented via an RDF resource of type dcat:Distribution.
</p>
<pre>  &nbsp;:dataset-001-csv
       a dcat:Distribution&nbsp;;
       dcat:downloadURL &lt;http://www.example.org/files/001.csv&gt; ;
       dct:title "CSV distribution of imaginary dataset 001" ;
       dcat:mediaType &lt;https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/csv&gt; ;
       dcat:byteSize "5120"^^xsd:decimal ;
       .
</pre>
</section>

<section id="classifying-datasets">
<h3>Classifying datasets thematically</h3>
<p>The catalog classifies its datasets according to a set of domains represented by the relative URI&nbsp;:themes. SKOS can be used to describe the domains used:
</p>
<pre>  &nbsp;:catalog&nbsp;dcat:themeTaxonomy&nbsp;:themes&nbsp;.
</pre>

<pre>  &nbsp;:themes
       a skos:ConceptScheme&nbsp;;
       skos:prefLabel "A set of domains to classify documents"&nbsp;;
       .
</pre>

<pre>  &nbsp;:dataset-001 dcat:theme&nbsp;:accountability&nbsp; .
</pre>
<p>Notice that this dataset is classified under the domain represented by the relative URI&nbsp;:accountability.
It is recommended to define the concept as part of the concepts scheme identified by the URI&nbsp;:themes that was used to describe the catalog domains. An example SKOS description:
</p>
<pre>  &nbsp;:accountability
       a skos:Concept&nbsp;;
       skos:inScheme&nbsp;:themes&nbsp;;
       skos:prefLabel "Accountability"&nbsp;;
       .
</pre>

<p>
	The type or genre of a dataset <em title="MAY" class="rfc2119">MAY</em> be indicated using the <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/type">dct:type</a> property.
	The value of the property <em title="SHOULD" class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> be taken from a well governed and broadly recognised set of resource types, such as the <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#section-7">DCMI Type Vocabulary</a>, the <a href="https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/marcgt.html">MARC Genre/Terms Scheme</a>, the <a href="https://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-4.1/include/datacite-resourceType-v4.1.xsd">DataCite resource types</a> or the PARSE.Insight content-types from Re3data [[re3data-schema]].

<section id="describing-catalog-records-metadata">
<h3>Describing catalog records metadata</h3>
<p>If the catalog publisher decides to keep metadata
describing its records (i.e. the records containing metadata
describing the datasets), dcat:CatalogRecord can be used. For example,
while &nbsp;:dataset-001 was issued on 2011-12-05, its description on Imaginary Catalog was added on 2011-12-11. This can be represented by DCAT as in the following:
</p>
<pre>  &nbsp;:catalog  dcat:record&nbsp;:record-001&nbsp; .
</pre>

<pre>  &nbsp;:record-001
       a dcat:CatalogRecord&nbsp;;

<p>:dataset-002 is available as a CSV file. However :dataset-002 can only be obtained through some Web page

		In many legacy catalogues and repositories (e.g. CKAN), ‘datasets’ are ‘just a bag of files’. There is no distinction made between part/whole, distribution (representation), and other kinds of relationship (e.g. documentation, schema, supporting documents) from the dataset to each of the files.

	<h3>Dataset provenance</h3>
	<p>
		The provenance or business context of a dataset can be described using elements from the W3C Provenance Ontology [[!PROV-O]].
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, a simple link from a dataset description to the project that generated the dataset can be formalized as follows (other details elided for clarity):
	</p>
	<pre>

	</p>
	<p>
		Several properties capture provenance information, including within the citation and title, but the primary link to a formal description of the project is through <a href="#Property:dataset_wasgeneratedby">prov:wasGeneratedBy</a>.
		A terse description of the project is shown as a <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#Activity">prov:Activity</a>, though this would not necessarily be part of the same catalog.
		Note that as the project is ongoing, the activity has no end date.
	</p>
	<p>
		Further provenance information might be provided using the other <i>starting point properties</i> from PROV, in particular <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#wasAttributedTo">prov:wasAttributedTo</a> (to link to an agent associated with the dataset production) and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#wasDerivedFrom">prov:wasDerivedFrom</a> (to link to a predecessor dataset). Both of these complement Dublin Core properties already used in DCAT, as follows:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>prov:wasAttributedTo</b> provides a general link to all kinds of associated agents, such as project sponsors, managers, dataset owners, etc which are not correctly characterized using <b>dct:creator</b>, <b>dct:contributor</b> or <b>dct:publisher</b>.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>prov:wasDerivedFrom</b> supports a more specific relationship to an input or predecessor dataset compared with <b>dct:source</b>, which is not necessarily a previous dataset.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		For a more detailed discussion of the use of PROV for dataset provenance, including recommendations on the use of <i>qualified properties</i>, see the chapter on <a href="#prov-patterns">Provenance Patterns</a> below.

<h3>RDF representation</h3>

<p class="note">
	The DCAT RDF representation is modularized into several files or graphs to help users access a version of DCAT with just the alignments that they need. This mechanism can also be used to capture different levels of axiomatization, though the status of such proposals has not been finalized. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/134">Issue #134</a> and the issues enumerated below.
</p>

<div class="issue" data-number="65">
	<p>
		Guidance on the use DCAT in a weakly-axiomatized environment, such as schema.org, has been identified as a requirement to be satisfied in this revision of DCAT.
	</p>
	<p>
		An <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/dxwg/dcat-build-test-daveb/dcat/rdf/dcat-schema.ttl">RDF graph containing a proposed alignment of DCAT with schema.org</a> is available. Comments on this alignment are invited.
	</p>
</div>

<p class="issue" data-number="105">
	The use of guarded constraints (existence, cardinality, range-type) to control the use of the recommended properties in the context of a class is being considered as part of the revision of DCAT.
</p>

<p class="issue" data-number="110">
	The axiomatization of DCAT 2014 used global domain and range constraints for many of the properties defined in the DCAT namespace [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]]. This makes quite strong ontological commitments, some of which are now being reconsidered - see individual issues noted inline below.
</p>

<p>The (revised) DCAT vocabulary is <a href="https://www.github.com/w3c/dxwg/tree/dcat-build-test-daveb/dcat/rdf/">available in RDF</a>.
The primary artefact <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/dxwg/dcat-build-test-daveb/dcat/rdf/dcat.ttl">dcat.ttl</a> is a serialization of the core DCAT vocabulary.
Alongside it are a set of other RDF files that provide additional information, including:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		alignments to other vocabularies, some of which are normative, and others which are for guidance only
	</li>
	<li>
		additional axioms, which can be useful in some contexts
	</li>
	<li>
		some profiles of DCAT, including a profile that corresponds to the 2014 version of DCAT [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]]
	</li>
</ol>

<p class="issue" data-number="144">
    The implementation of a DCAT 2014 profile of the revised DCAT is being considered.

	The scope of DCAT 2014 was limited to catalogs of datasets [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]].
	A number of use cases for the revision involve also having <b>data distribution services</b> as members of a catalog - see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#ID6">DCAT Distribution to describe web services - ID6</a> and
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#ID18">Modeling service-based data access - ID18</a>.
It has been decided to add an explicit class for Data Distribution Services in this revision of DCAT, and to enable these to be part of a Catalog.
Provision for other services to also be part of a Catalog will also be made, as well as for Catalogs to be composed of other Catalogs.

	<a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/relation">dct:relation</a> is a super-property of a number of more specific properties which express more precise relationships, so use of dct:relation is not inconsistent with a subsequent reclassification with more specific semantics, though the more specialized sub-properties <em title="SHOULD" class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> be used to link a dataset to component and supplementary resources if possible.

	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#RDSC">Dataset citation</a> is one of the requirements identified for the DCAT revision.
	Data citation is the practice of referencing data in a similar way as when providing bibliographic references, acknowledging data
	as a first class output in any investigative process. Data citation offers multiple benefits, such as crediting those producing the data,
	facilitating data discovery, supporting tracking the impact and reuse of data.

	To support data citation, the dataset description should include at a minimum: the dataset identifier, the dataset creator (added in this DCAT revision
	as part of the properties recommended for Dataset), the dataset title, the dataset publisher and the dataset release date.

	The constraints on the availability of such properties in the dataset description can be represented as a DCAT data citation profile.

    <h2>Quality information</h2>
<div class="note"><p>This section is not-normative as it provides guidance on how to document the quality of DCAT first class entities (e.g., datasets, distributions) and it does not define new DCAT terms. The guidance relies on the Data Quality Vocabulary(DQV)[[vocab-dqv]], which is a W3C Group Note.</p></div>   

The Data Quality Vocabulary (DQV) offers common modelling patterns for different aspects of Data Quality.

It can relate  DCAT datasets and distributions with different types of quality information including
<ul>
    <li> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dqv/#dqv:QualityAnnotation"> dqv:QualityAnnotation</a>, which represents feedback and quality certificates given about the dataset or its distribution. </li>
    <li> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dqv/#dqv:QualityPolicy">dqv:QualityPolicy</a>, which represents a policy or agreement that is chiefly governed by data quality concerns.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dqv/#dqv:QualityMeasurement">dqv:QualityMeasurement</a>, which represents a metric value providing quantitative or qualitative information about the dataset or distribution.</li>
</ul>

Each type of quality information can pertain to one or more quality dimensions, namely, quality characteristics relevant to the consumer. The practice to see the quality as a multi-dimensional space is consolidated in the field of quality management to split the quality management into addressable chunks. DQV does not define a normative list of quality dimensions. It offers the quality dimensions proposed in ISO/IEC 25012 [[ISOIEC25012]] and Zaveri et al. [[ZaveriEtAl]] as two possible starting points. It also provides an <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ldqd">RDF representation</a> for the quality dimensions and categories defined in the latter. Ultimately, implementers will need to choose themselves the collection of quality dimensions that best fits their needs.

The following section shows how DCAT and DQV can be coupled to describe the quality of datasets and distributions.
For a comprehensive introduction  and further examples of use, please refer to the Data Quality Vocabulary (DQV) group note [[vocab-dqv]].
<div class="note">
<p>The following examples make no comments on where the quality information would reside and how it is managed. That is out of scope for the DCAT vocabulary.  The assumption made is that the quality individuals are available using the URIs indicated.
Besides, the examples and more in general the DQV  is neutral to the data portal design choices on how to collect quality information. For example, data portals can collect DQV instances by implementing specific UI to annotate data or by taking inputs from 3rd-party services.

	    A data consumer (:consumer1)  describes the quality of the dataset :genoaBusStopsDataset that includes a georeferenced list of bus stops in Genoa. He/she annotates the dataset with a DQV quality note (:genoaBusStopsDatasetCompletenessNote) about data completeness (ldqd:completeness) to warn that the dataset includes only 20500 out of the 30000 stops.

<h2>Documenting conformance to standards</h2>
    <p class="issue" data-number="58">
	The issue suggests to represent "the degree a dataset conforms to a stated quality standard" and "the details of data quality conformance test results". This section is a starter to deal with the above requests by relying on the existing  W3C vocabularies.
    Comments and suggestions about the following examples as well as the proposal of alternative patterns are more than welcome.
    </p>
<p> This subsection  shows different modelling patterns combining DQV [[vocab-dqv]] with  PROV [[PROV-O]] and EARL [[EARL10-Schema]] to represent the conformance degree to a stated quality standard and the details about the conformance tests.

<section id="quality-conformance-statement"> 
<h3>Conformance to a standard</h3>
 <p>The use of <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-conformsTo">dct:conformsTo</a> and <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-Standard">dct:Standard</a> is a well-known pattern to represent the conformance to a standard. The following example declares a fictional a:Dataset conformant to the "Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010 of 23 November 2010 implementing Directive 2007/2/EC".</p>

<h3> Degree of conformance</h3>
     <p>Some legal context requires to specify the degree of conformance. For example,  INSPIRE metadata adopts a specific <a href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/DegreeOfConformity">controlled vocabulary</a> to express  non-conformance and non-evaluation beside the full compliance. As suggested in [[geodcat-ap]], the following example specifies the degree of conformance (i.e.,  not conformant) by declaring the  <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-type">dct:type</a> for the result of conformance test.  [[geodcat-ap]] suggests to use a PROV entity to model the  conformance test (e.g., a:TestResult),  a PROV activity to model the testing activity (e,g., a:TestingActivity), a PROV plan derived by the INSPIRE Directive to represent  conformance test (e.g., a:ConformanceTest). A qualified PROV association binds the testing activity to the conformance test.

<p>Also,  DQV [[vocab-dqv]] can be deployed to  measure the compliance to a specific standard. In the following, the :levelOfComplianceToINSPIRE is a quality metrics which measures the compliance of a dataset to INSPIRE in terms of the percentage of passed compliance tests. The example assumes iso as a namespace representing the quality dimensions and categories defined in the ISO/IEC 25012.</p>

<p>The quality measurement :measurement_complianceToINSPIRE represents the level of compliance for a dataset a:Dataset, namely, measurement of the metric :levelOfComplianceToINSPIRE. If only a part of the compliance tests succeeds (e.g. half of the compliance tests), the measurement would look like in the following:</p>

<h3>Conformance test results</h3>
    <p> Further information about the tests can be provided using EARL [[EARL10-Schema]]. EARL provides specific classes to describe the testing activity, which can be adopted in conjunction with PROV. 
The following example describes the Testing activity a:TestingActivity as an EARL Assertion instead of a qualified association on the PROV activity. The EARL Assertion states the dataset a:Dataset has been tested with the conformance test a:ConformanceTest, and it has passed the test as described in a:testResult.

	<p>
		A <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/Datasets">mapping between DCAT 2014 and schema.org</a> was discussed on the original proposal to extend schema.org for describing datasets and data catalogs.

		This mapping is axiomatized using the standard predicates <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code>, <code>rdfs:subPropertyOf</code>, <code>owl:equivalentClass</code>, <code>owl:equivalentProperty</code>, and also using the
		annotation properties <code>schema:domainIncludes</code> and <code>schema:rangeIncludes</code> to match schema.org semantics. The mapping is summarized in the table below, considering the prefix <code>schema</code> as <code>http://schema.org/</code>.

	<h2>Relation to other W3C Recommendations</h2>

	<p class="issue" data-number="254">
		DCAT should be aligned with other recent Linked Data based Recommendations.
	</p>

	<section id="ldp">
		<h3>Linked Data Platform (LDP)</h3>

		<p>
			DCAT provides a data model for representation of metadata about datasets in the form of Linked Data, but it does not specify how this metadata can be accessed or modified.
			The DCAT compatible metadata can be viewed as collections of Catalog Records, Datasets and Data Services contained in a Catalog, and a collection of Distributions contained in a Dataset.
			The Linked Data Platform [[ldp]] specification deals with access to and modification of Linked Data Platform Containers (LDPCs).
			This section provides guidance on how to represent DCAT metadata as LDP Containers, which supports namely the implementation of <a href="https://solid.mit.edu/" title="Solid">Solid</a> based DCAT catalogs.
		</p>

		<p>
			First, we will present an example of a LDPC for datasets in a catalog.
			There is one catalog with one dataset.
			The dataset is contained in the <code>&lt;/datasets/&gt;</code> LDP Direct Container.
			To ensure the LDPC discovery, we connect it to the Catalog using the <code>dcat:datasets</code> predicate.
		</p>
		<div class="example">
			<div class="example-title marker">
				<span>Example 1</span>
			</div>
			<pre class="nohighlight turtle" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
@prefix dcat: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#&gt; .
@prefix ldp:  &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#&gt; .

@base &lt;https://example.org/resource/catalog&gt; .

&lt;&gt; a dcat:Catalog ;
	dcat:datasets &lt;/datasets/&gt; ;
	dcat:dataset &lt;/datasets/001&gt; .

&lt;/datasets/&gt; a ldp:Container, ldp:DirectContainer ;
	ldp:membershipResource &lt;&gt; ;
	ldp:hasMemberRelation dcat:dataset ;
	ldp:contains &lt;/datasets/001&gt; .

&lt;/datasets/001&gt; a dcat:Dataset .</pre>
		</div>

		<p>
			In the second example, we add LDPCs <code>&lt;/records/&gt;</code> for Catalog Records and <code>&lt;/services/&gt;</code> for Data Services, discoverable using <code>dcat:records</code> and <code>dcat:services</code> predicates from the Catalog:
		</p>
		<div class="example">
			<div class="example-title marker">
				<span>Example 2</span>
			</div>
			<pre class="nohighlight turtle" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
@prefix dcat: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#&gt; .
@prefix ldp:  &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#&gt; .

@base &lt;https://example.org/resource/catalog&gt; .

&lt;&gt; a dcat:Catalog ;
	dcat:records &lt;/records/&gt; ;
	dcat:datasets &lt;/datasets/&gt; ;
	dcat:services &lt;/services/&gt; ;
	dcat:dataset &lt;/datasets/001&gt; .

&lt;/records/&gt; a ldp:Container, ldp:DirectContainer ;
	ldp:membershipResource &lt;&gt; ;
	ldp:hasMemberRelation dcat:record ;
	ldp:contains &lt;/records/001&gt; .

&lt;/datasets/&gt; a ldp:Container, ldp:DirectContainer ;
	ldp:membershipResource &lt;&gt; ;
	ldp:hasMemberRelation dcat:dataset ;
	ldp:contains &lt;/datasets/001&gt; .

&lt;/services/&gt; a ldp:Container, ldp:DirectContainer ;
	ldp:membershipResource &lt;&gt; ;
	ldp:hasMemberRelation dcat:service ;
	ldp:contains &lt;/services/001&gt; .

&lt;/records/001&gt; a dcat:CatalogRecord ;
	foaf:primaryTopic &lt;/datasets/001&gt; .

&lt;/datasets/001&gt; a dcat:Dataset ;

&lt;/services/001&gt; a dcat:DataService .</pre>
		</div>
		<p>
			Each dataset has its own LDPC for its distributions.
			In the third example, we show the LDPC <code>&lt;/datasets/001/distributions/&gt;</code> for distributions of a single dataset, <code>&lt;/datasets/001&gt;</code>, discoverable through the <code>dcat:distributions</code> predicate.
		</p>
		<div class="example">
			<div class="example-title marker">
				<span>Example 3</span>
			</div>
			<pre class="nohighlight turtle" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">

		the Linked Data Platform Paging mechanism [[ldp-paging]] <em title="SHOULD" class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> be used to provide access to them.</p>

        <h3>Changes since the W3C Recommendation of 16 January 2014</h3>
        <p>The document has undergone the following changes since the W3C Recommendation of 16 January 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]]:</p>

       <ul>

<li>
	<a href="#Property:dataset_creator">Property: dataset creator</a>: The property dct:creator is recommended for use in the context of a dataset to allow the entity responsible for generating the dataset to be recorded - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/61">Issue #61</a>
</li>


<li>
	<a href="#Property:dataset_wasgeneratedby">Property: was generated by</a>: The property prov:wasGeneratedBy is recommended for use in the context of a dataset to allow the provenance or business context to be recorded - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/71">Issue #71</a>
</li>

<li>
	<a href="#Property:resource_relation">Property: resource relation</a>: The property dct:relation is recommended for use in the context of a catalogued resource to capture general relationships, including the case where the package of resources associated with a catalogued item includes a mixture of representations, parts, documentation and other elements which are not strictly 'distributions' of a dataset - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/253">Issue #253</a>.
</li>


<li>
	<a href="#Property:distribution_media_type">Property:media_type</a>: The range of dcat:mediaType has been tightened from dct:MediaTypeOrExtent to dct:MediaType - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/127">Issue #127</a>.
</li>

<li>
	<a href="#Property:distribution_conformsto">Property: conforms to</a>: The property dct:conformsTo is recommended for use in the context of a dcat:Distribution to allow the model or schema used for the representation to be indicated as well as the serialization (which is indicated using dct:format and dcat:mediaType) - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/55">Issue #55</a>.
</li>

<li>
	Errors in examples of <a href="#Property:distribution_media_type">dcat:mediaType</a> usage fixed - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/170">Issue #170</a>.
</li>

<li>
	<a href="#quality-information">Quality information</a>: Recommendations for how to associate quality information to datasets using elements from the W3C DQV vocabulary [[vocab-dqv]] are provided. Since [[vocab-dqv]] is not a rec-track document, these are non-normative - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/57">Issue #57</a> and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/58">Issue #58</a>.
</li>

<li>
	<a href="#Class:Resource">Class: Catalogued resource</a>: In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the scope of a <a href="#Class:Catalog">dcat:Catalog</a> was limited to Datasets. This has been generalized, and properties common to all catalogued resources are now associated with a super-class dcat:Resource - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">Issue #172</a> and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/116">Issue #116</a>. The wiki page on <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/wiki/Cataloguing-data-services">Cataloguing data services</a> describes some proposals related to this requirement.
</li>

<li>
	<a href="#Class:Data_Service">Class: Data service</a>: In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the scope of a <a href="#Class:Catalog">dcat:Catalog</a> was limited to Datasets. The new class dcat:DataService has been added to support cataloguing various kinds of data services - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">Issue #172</a>.
</li>

<li>
	<a href="#Class:Data_Distribution_Service">Class: Data distribution service</a>: In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the scope of a <a href="#Class:Catalog">dcat:Catalog</a> was limited to Datasets. The new class dcat:DataDistributionService has been added to support cataloguing data distribution services - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">Issue #172</a> and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/56">Issue #56</a>.
</li>

<li>
	<a href="#Class:Discovery_Service">Class: Discovery service</a>: In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the scope of a <a href="#Class:Catalog">dcat:Catalog</a> was limited to Datasets. The new class dcat:DiscoveryService has been added to support cataloguing data discovery services - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">Issue #172</a>.
</li>

<li><a href="#Class:Dataset">Class: Dataset</a>:
In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] <a href="#Class:Dataset">dcat:Dataset</a> was a sub-class of <a href="http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Dataset">dctype:Dataset</a>, which is a term of the <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#section-7">DCMI Types vocabulary</a> [[DCTERMS]]. This relationship has been removed in the revised DCAT vocabulary - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/98">Issue #98</a>.
</li>

<li>
	<a href="#Class:Distribution">Class: Distribution</a>
	: In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the definition of a <a href="#Class:Distribution">dcat:Distribution</a> allowed a number of alternative interpretations. The definition has been rephrased to clarify that distributions are primarily <i>representations</i> of datasets. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">Issue #52</a> and related use cases.
</li>
       

<li><a href="#Property:resource_theme">Property: theme/category</a>:
	In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the domain of dcat:theme was dcat:Dataset,
  which limited use of this property in other contexts. The domain has been relaxed in this revision -
  see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/123">Issue #123</a>.
</li>

<li><a href="#Property:resource_type">Property: type/genre</a>:
	Added in DCAT revision - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/64">Issue #64</a>, with examples of usage in overview section.
</li>

<li><a href="#Property:resource_keyword">Property: keyword/tag</a>:

  which limited use of this property in other contexts. The domain has been relaxed in this revision -

<li><a href="http://vocab.org/vann/#usageNote">Property: vann:usageNote</a>:
    DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] included documentation captured as text using <a href="http://vocab.org/vann/#usageNote">vann:usageNote</a> elements,
    which is a sub-property of rdfs:seeAlso - an owl:ObjectProperty that cannot have a Literal value.
    This revision of DCAT has fixed these issues and replaced the use of vann:usageNote with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/#secdocumentation">skos:scopeNote</a> -
    see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/233">Issue #233</a>.
