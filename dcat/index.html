    <p>DCAT is an RDF vocabulary designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogs published on the Web.
      This document defines the schema and provides examples for its use.</p>
    <p>DCAT enables a publisher to describe datasets and data services in a catalog using a standard model and vocabulary that facilitates the consumption and aggregation of metadata from multiple catalogs.
        This can increase the discoverability of datasets and data services.
        It also makes it possible to have a decentralized approach to publishing data catalogs and makes federated search for datasets across catalogs in multiple sites possible using the same query mechanism and structure.
        Aggregated DCAT metadata can serve as a manifest file as part of the digital preservation process.</p>

        Since the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/WD-vocab-dcat-2-20180508/">First Public Working Draft</a>, the main changes to the DCAT vocabulary in Version 2 have been:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>addition of a <a href="#Class:Resource"><code>dcat:Resource</code></a> class for representing any asset than can be included in the catalog.  This is
            now the super-class of <a href="#Class:Dataset"><code>dcat:Dataset</code></a></li>
        <li>addition of <a href="#Class:Data_Service"><code>dcat:DataService</code></a>, as a sub-class of <a href="#Class:Resource"><code>dcat:Resource</code></a>, so that catalogs can now hold information about service end-points that provide access to data assets</li>
        <li>addition of ways to represent <a href="#bag-of-files"></a>, where there is no distinction between a dataset and its distributions, such as in many open data repositories</li>
        <li>more details for the ways of representing <a href="#examples-dataset-provenance"></a> and <a href="#quality-information"></a></li>
        <li>an <a href="#dcat-sdo"></a> between the DCAT vocabulary and the schema.org vocabulary</li>

    <h3 id="dcat_history">DCAT history</h3>
    <p>The original DCAT vocabulary was developed and <a href="http://vocab.deri.ie/dcat">hosted</a> at the Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI), then refined by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/egov/">eGov Interest Group</a>, and finally standardized in 2014 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/gld/">Government Linked Data (GLD)</a> Working Group.</p>
    <p>This revised version of DCAT, Version 2, was developed by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/">Dataset Exchange Working Group</a> in response to a new set of Use Cases and Requirements [[?DCAT-UCR]] gathered from peoples' experiences with the DCAT vocabulary from the time of the original version, and new applications that were not considered in the first version.

    <h3 id="external_terms">External terms</h3>
    <p>DCAT incorporates terms from pre-existing vocabularies where stable terms with appropriate meanings could be found, such as <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage"><code>foaf:homepage</code></a> and <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/title"><code>dct:title</code></a>.
      Informal summary definitions of the externally-defined terms are included here for convenience, while authoritative definitions are available in the normative references.
      Changes to definitions in the references, if any, supersede the summaries given in this specification.
      Note that conformance to DCAT (Section 4) concerns usage of only the terms in the DCAT namespace itself, so possible changes to the external definitions will not affect the conformance of DCAT implementations.</p>

    <h3 id="please_send_comments">Please send comments</h3>
    The Working Group invites publishers to describe their catalogs and datasets with the revised version of DCAT described in this document and to report their implementations following <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/wiki/DCAT-implementation-evidence">the instruction  to reporting DCAT revised implementations</a>. The information gathered through this means will be augmented by further analysis of implementation available on the Web. The Working Group expects to adduce the combined set of evidence when requesting that the Director advance this document to Proposed Recommendation.

<section id="introduction" class="informative">

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Sharing data resources among different organizations, researchers, governments and citizens requires the provision of metadata.
        This is irrespective of the data being open or not.
        DCAT is a vocabulary for publishing data catalogs on the Web.  It is equally able to be used to publish data catalogs within organisations using web technologies. It was originally developed in the context of government data catalogs
        such as <a href="https://www.data.gov/">data.gov</a> and <a href="https://data.gov.uk">data.gov.uk</a>, but it is also applicable and has been used in other contexts.
    <p>

    <p>
        This revision of DCAT, version 2, has extended version 1 to support further use cases and requirements [[?DCAT-UCR]].
        These include the possibility of cataloguing other data resources in addition to
        datasets, such as data services. Version 2 also supports describing relationships between datasets, and relationships between
        datasets and other catalogued resources.  Guidance on how to document licenses and rights statements associated with the catalogued items is provided.
   </p>

   <p>
    DCAT provides RDF classes and properties to allow datasets and data services to be described and included in a catalog.
    The use of a standard model and vocabulary facilitates the consumption and aggregation of metadata from multiple catalogs, which can:</p>


    <ol>
      <li>
        increase the discoverability of datasets and data services
      </li>
      <li>
        allow federated search for datasets across catalogs in multiple sites
      </li>
      <li>
        allow standardisation of tools and other cataloging products to a common model
      </li>
    </ol>


    <p>
        Data described in a catalog can come in many formats, ranging from spreadsheets, through XML and RDF to various specialized formats.
        DCAT does not make any assumptions about these serialization formats of the datasets but it does
        distinguish between the abstract concept of a dataset and the real manifestations or distributions of the dataset such as CSV files, spreadsheets and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
        Data is often provided as a service accessed through a web form or an API that supports the selection of an extract, sub-set, or combination of data.
        DCAT allows the description of a data access service to be included in a catalog.
    </p>

    <p>
      Complementary vocabularies can be used together with DCAT to provide more detailed format-specific information.
      For example, properties from the VoID vocabulary [[?VOID]] can be used within DCAT to express various statistics about a dataset if that dataset is in RDF format.
    </p>

    <p>
      This document does not prescribe any particular method of deploying data catalogs expressed in DCAT.
      DCAT information can be presented in many forms including RDF accessible via SPARQL endpoints, embedded in HTML pages as [[?HTML-RDFa]], or serialized as RDF/XML [[?RDF-SYNTAX-GRAMMAR]], [[?N3]], [[?Turtle]], [[?JSON-LD]] or other formats.
      Within this document the examples use Turtle because of it is the easiest format in which to see the underlying RDF model.

<section id="motivation" class="informative"><h2>Motivation for change</h2>
    <p>The original Recommendation [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]]  (version 1) published in January 2014 provided the basic framework for describing datasets. It made an important distinction between a <i>dataset</i> as an abstract idea and a <i>distribution</i> as a 'manifestation' of the dataset. Although DCAT has been widely adopted, it has become clear that the original specification lacked a number of essential features as we have seen that people have made additions to the original model either through the mechanism of an application profile, such as the European Commission's DCAT-AP [[?DCAT-AP]], or through the development of larger vocabularies that to a greater or lesser extent build upon the base standard, such as the Healthcare and Life Sciences Community Profile [[?HCLS-Dataset]], the Data Tag Suite [[?DATS]] and many others. This revision of DCAT addresses many of the shortcomings of version 1 that have come to light through the experiences of different communities.
    For example, in this new DCAT version we provide classes, properties and guidance to address <a href="#dereferenceable-identifiers"></a>, <a href="#quality-information"></a>, and <a href="#data-citation"></a> issues.</p>
    <p>Significant changes from the 2014 Recommendation are marked within the text using "Note" sections, as well as being described in the <a href="#changes"></a> section.</p>

    <p>The namespace for DCAT is <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#</code>.
        However, note that DCAT makes extensive use of terms from other vocabularies, in particular Dublin Core [[?DCTERMS]].
        DCAT defines a minimal set of classes and properties of its own.

<section id="conformance">

    <p class="note">Modified from DCAT 2014 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]]</p>

    <p>A data catalog conforms to DCAT if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Access to data is organized into datasets, distributions, and data-services. </li>
        <li> An RDF description of the catalog itself and its datasets, distributions, and data-services is available (but the choice of
            RDF syntax, access protocol, and access policy are not mandated by this specification).</li>
        <li>The contents of all metadata fields that are held in the catalog and that contain data about the catalog itself and its datasets, distributions, and data-services, are included in this RDF description and are expressed using the appropriate classes and properties from DCAT, where these are available.</li>
        <li> All classes and properties defined in DCAT are used in a way consistent with the semantics declared in this specification.</li>
        <li>DCAT-compliant catalogs MAY include additional non-DCAT metadata fields and additional RDF data in the catalog's RDF description to describe aspects outside the scope of DCAT or where DCAT does not support appropriate description.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        A <strong>DCAT profile</strong> is a specification for a data catalog that adds additional constraints to DCAT. A data catalog that conforms to the profile also conforms to DCAT. Additional constraints in a profile MAY include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Cardinality constraints, including a minimum set of required metadata fields </li>
        <li> Sub-classes and sub-properties of the standard DCAT classes and properties</li>
        <li> Classes and properties for additional metadata fields not covered in DCAT</li>
        <li> Controlled vocabularies or URI sets as acceptable values for properties</li>
        <li> Requirements for specific access mechanisms (RDF syntaxes, protocols) to the catalog's RDF description</li>

    <h2>Vocabulary Overview</h2>

<section id="dcat-scope">
    <h3>DCAT Scope</h3>
    
    <p>All sorts of things can be catalogued, and at some point the DCAT scope might include real-world objects such as facilities, but at present the scope of DCAT is generally understood as being catalogs of information assets.  This sort of "data" comes in many forms including numbers, words, pixels, imagery, sound and other multi-media, and potentially other types, any of which might be collected into a dataset.</p>

    <p>DCAT is an RDF vocabulary for representing data catalogs.
      DCAT is based around eight main classes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="#Class:Catalog"><code>dcat:Catalog</code></a> represents a catalog, which is a dataset in which each individual item is a metadata record describing some resource; the scope of <code>dcat:Catalog</code> is collections of metadata about <b>datasets</b> or <b>data services</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#Class:Resource"><code>dcat:Resource</code></a> represents an individual item in a catalog.
          This class is not intended to be used directly, but is the parent class of <a href="#Class:Dataset"><code>dcat:Dataset</code></a>, <a href="#Class:Data_Service"><code>dcat:DataService</code></a> and <a href="#Class:Catalog"><code>dcat:Catalog</code></a>.
          Member items in a catalog should be members of one of these sub-classes, or of a sub-class of these, or of a sub-class of <a href="#Class:Resource"><code>dcat:Resource</code></a> defined in a DCAT application profile or other DCAT application.
          <a href="#Class:Resource"><code>dcat:Resource</code></a> is effectively an extension point for defining a catalog of any kind of resource.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#Class:Dataset"><code>dcat:Dataset</code></a> represents a dataset in a catalog.
          A dataset is a collection of data, published or curated by a single agent.
          
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#Class:Distribution"><code>dcat:Distribution</code></a> represents an accessible form of a dataset such as a downloadable file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#Class:Data_Service"><code>dcat:DataService</code></a> is used in a catalog to represent a data service.
          A data service is a collection of operations accessible through an interface (a web form, or an <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>) that provides access to one or more datasets or data processing functions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#Class:Catalog_Record"><code>dcat:CatalogRecord</code></a> represents a metadata item in the catalog, primarily concerned with the registration information, such as who added the item and when.
        </li>
    </ul>

          Overview of DCAT model, showing the classes of resources that can be members of a Catalog, and the relationships between them.

    </figure>
    
    <p class="note">
        Along with the rest of the <a href="#vocabulary-overview"></a>, this diagram is <b>non-normative</b>.
        Furthermore, while the diagram uses UML-style class notation it should be interpreted following the usual RDF open-world assumptions around the presence/absence of properties and relationships, and their cardinalities.
        The properties shown in each class reflect those recommended in the descriptions of classes in the <a href="#vocabulary-specification"></a>.
        To assist in understanding the full scope of each class, properties are copied down from each '::super-class'.
        Cardinalities are shown in a few places to reinforce the idea of what is expected in DCAT, but these are not axiomatized or enforced in any way by this recommendation.
    </p>

    <p>
        A <b>dataset</b> in DCAT is defined as a "collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more serializations or formats".
        A dataset is a conceptual entity, and can be represented by one or more <b>distributions</b> that serialize the dataset for transfer (e.g. a CSV file; a PDF document; a set of database files; etc.).
        Distributions of a dataset can also be provided from <b>data services</b>.
        Detailed properties for a data service API are out of the scope of this version of DCAT.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <b>data service</b> in DCAT is a collection of operations or API which provides access to data.
      An interactive interface may provide access to the API operations.
      A data service typically provides selection, extraction, combination, processing or transformation operations over datasets that might be hosted locally or remotely to the service.
      A data service might be tied to specific datasets, or its source data might be configured at request- or run-time.
      The result of a request to a data service is a representation of a part or all of a dataset or catalog.
      A data service might represent a data distribution service to select and download a distribution of a dataset or subset, or a data discovery service to find the description of a suitable dataset.
      Some kinds of data service are outside the scope of the current DCAT vocabulary, such as data transformation services like coordinate transformation services, re-sampling and interpolation services, and various data processing services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Descriptions of datasets and data services can be included in a <b>catalog</b>.
      A catalog is a kind of dataset whose member items are descriptions of datasets and data services.
      The recommended approach to extend the scope of a catalog beyond datasets and data services is to define additional sub-classes of <a href="#Class:Resource"><code>dcat:Resource</code></a> in a DCAT application profile or other DCAT application.
      To extend the scope of service descriptions beyond data distribution services the recommended approach is also to define additional sub-classes of <a href="#Class:Data_Service"><code>dcat:DataService</code></a> in a DCAT application profile or other DCAT application.
    </p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>
        The scope of DCAT 2014 (Version 1) [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] was limited to catalogs of datasets.
        A number of use cases for Version 2 [[?DCAT-UCR]] involve <b>data services</b> as members of a catalog - see <a data-cite="DCAT-UCR#ID6">DCAT Distribution to describe web services - ID6</a> and
        <a data-cite="DCAT-UCR#ID18">Modeling service-based data access - ID18</a>.
        Hence, the scope of DCAT Version 2 includes both datasets and data services and both can be part of a DCAT-conformant catalog.
        Provision for Catalogs to be composed of other Catalogs is also included in Version 2.
        See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">Issue #172</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As mentioned above, physical artefacts, events or activities, etc. are currently out of scope for DCAT, but might be defined through further sub-classes of <a href="#Class:Resource"><code>dcat:Resource</code></a>, which could be specified in a DCAT application profile or other DCAT application.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>A <b>catalog record</b> describes an entry in the catalog. Notice that while <a href="#Class:Resource"><code>dcat:Resource</code></a> represents the dataset or service itself, <a href="#Class:Catalog_Record"><code>dcat:CatalogRecord</code></a> is the record that describes the registration of an item in the catalog. The use of <a href="#Class:Catalog_Record"><code>dcat:CatalogRecord</code></a> is considered optional. It is used to capture provenance information about entries in a catalog explicitly. If this is not necessary then <a href="#Class:Catalog_Record"><code>dcat:CatalogRecord</code></a> can be safely ignored.</p>

  <section id="dcat-rdf">
    <h3>RDF considerations</h3>
      <p id="owl2">
        The DCAT vocabulary is an OWL2 ontology [[?OWL2-OVERVIEW]] formalized using [[?RDF-SCHEMA]].
        Each class and property in DCAT is denoted by an [[?IRI]].
        Locally-defined elements are in the namespace <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#"><code>http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#</code></a>.
        Elements are also brought into the DCAT model from several external vocabularies, in particular [[?FOAF]], [[?DCTERMS]] and [[?PROV-O]]
      </p>
      <p id="blankNodes">
        RDF allows resources to either have global identifiers (IRIs) or to be "blank nodes".
        Blank nodes can be used to denote resources without explicitly naming them with an IRI.
        They can appear in the subject and object position of a triple [[?RDF11-PRIMER]].
        For example, in many DCAT catalogs distributions of datasets are represented as blank nodes nested inside the related dataset description.
        While blank nodes can offer flexibility for some use cases, in a Linked Data context blank nodes limit our ability to  annotate data collaboratively across many organisations because a blank node resource cannot be the target of a link outside of the database that holds it, and so it can't be annotated with new information from new sources.
        As one of the biggest benefits of the Linked Data approach is that "anyone can say anything about anything", using blank nodes undermines some of the advantages available from wide adoption of the RDF model.
        Even within the closed world of a single application dataset, use of blank nodes can quickly become limiting when integrating new data [[?LinkedDataPatterns]].
        For these reasons, it is recommended that instances of the DCAT main classes have a global identifier, and use of blank nodes is generally discouraged when encoding DCAT in RDF.

          Five distinct temporal descriptors are shown for this dataset.
          The dataset publication and revision dates are shown using the <a href="#Property:resource_release_date"><code>dct:issued</code></a> and <a href="#Property:resource_update_date"><code>dct:modified</code></a> predicates.
          For the frequency of updates of the dataset in <a href="#Property:dataset_frequency"><code>dct:accrualPeriodicity</code></a>, we use an instance from the <a data-cite="VOCAB-DATA-CUBE#dsd-cog">Content-Oriented Guidelines</a> developed as part of the W3C Data Cube Vocabulary [[?VOCAB-DATA-CUBE]] standard.
          The temporal coverage or extent is given using <a href="#Property:dataset_temporal"><code>dct:temporal</code></a> and an item from the Interval dataset (originally available from <code>http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/interval</code>) from data.gov.uk.
          The temporal resolution, which describes the minimum time interval spacing of items within the dataset, is given using <a href="#Property:dataset_temporalresolution"><code>dcat:temporalResolution</code></a> and the the literal for the period is typed using the standard XML Schema <code>xsd:duration</code> datatype.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, the spatial coverage or extent is given using the  <a href="#Property:dataset_spatial"><code>dct:spatial</code></a> term using a URI from <a href="http://www.geonames.org/">Geonames</a> as the object.
          The spatial resolution, which describes the minimum spatial separation of items within the dataset, is given using the <a href="#Property:dataset_spatialresolution"><code>dcat:spatialResolutionInMeters</code></a> predicate and again the literal is typed  using the standard datatype <code>xsd:decimal</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A contact point is provided where comments and feedback about the dataset can be sent.
          Further details about the contact point, such as email address or telephone number, can be provided using the vCard [[?VCARD-RDF]] vocabulary.

        <p>The catalog can be used to classify datasets according to a set of domains represented by the relative URI&nbsp;<code>:themes</code>. SKOS [[?SKOS-REFERENCE]] is an RDF vocabulary that can be used to mark up the concepts in these domains, show how they relate to each other, and identify the various text labels that they have:

            It is recommended that the value of the property is be taken from a well-governed and broadly-recognised set of resource types,
            such as the <a data-cite="?DCTERMS#section-7">DCMI Type Vocabulary</a> [[?DCTERMS]],

    <section id="RDF-representation">
        <h3>RDF representation</h3>

        <p class="ednote">
            The DCAT RDF representation is modularized into several files or graphs to help users access a configuration of DCAT with only the parts that they need.
            This mechanism can also be used to capture different levels of axiomatization, though the status of such proposals has not been finalized.
            See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/134">Issue #134</a> and the issues listed below.
        </p>

        <p>The DCAT Version 2 vocabulary is <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/tree/gh-pages/dcat/rdf/">available in RDF</a>.
            The primary artefact <a href="https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/dcat/rdf/dcat.ttl"><code>dcat.ttl</code></a> is a serialization in Turtle of the core DCAT vocabulary.
            Alongside it are a set of other RDF files that provide additional information, including:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                non-normative alignments to other vocabularies, provided for guidance
            </li>
            <li>
                additional axioms, which can be useful in some contexts
            </li>
            <li>
                some profiles of DCAT, including a profile that corresponds to Version 1 - the 2014 version of DCAT [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]]

    <section id="external-vocab">
      <h3>Elements from other vocabularies</h3>

      <p>
        DCAT requires use of elements from a number of other vocabularies.
        DCAT may also be augmented by additional elements from external vocabularies following the usual RDFS [[!RDF-SCHEMA]] and OWL2 [[!OWL2-OVERVIEW]] rules and patterns.
      </p>

    <section id="complements">
      <h4>Complementary vocabularies</h4>
      <p>
          Elements from a number of complementary vocabularies MAY be used together with DCAT to provide more detailed information.
        For example: properties from the VoID vocabulary [[?VOID]] allow the description of various statistics about a DCAT-described dataset if that dataset is in RDF format; properties from the Provenance ontology [[!PROV-O]] can be used to provide more information about the workflow activities and agents that generated a dataset or service; classes and properties from the Organization Ontology [[!VOCAB-ORG]] can be used to explain additional details of the responsible agents.

    </section>
    <section id="dependencies">
        <h4>Element definitions</h4>

        <p>
            The definitions (including domain and range) of terms outside the DCAT namespace are only provided here for convenience and MUST NOT be considered normative. The authoritative definitions of these terms are in their corresponding source specifications, i.e. [[!DC11]], [[!DCTERMS]], [[!FOAF]], [[!PROV-O]], [[!RDF-SCHEMA]], [[!SKOS-REFERENCE]], [[!XMLSCHEMA11-2]] and [[?VCARD-RDF]].

                <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/relation"><code>dct:relation</code></a> is a super-property of a number of more specific properties which express more precise relationships, so use of <code>dct:relation</code> is not inconsistent with a subsequent reclassification with more specific semantics, though the more specialized sub-properties SHOULD be used to link a dataset to component and supplementary resources if possible.

            <p> Examples of distributions include a CSV file, a netCDF file, a JSON document, or a data-cube, files made accessible according to different profiles, such as XML or JSON schemas or ShEx or SHACL expressions.</p>

            <p>In some cases all distributions of a dataset will be fully informationally equivalent, in the sense that lossless transformations between the representations are possible.
            An example would be different serializations of an RDF graph using RDF/XML, Turtle, N3, JSON-LD.
            However, in other cases the distributions might have different levels of fidelity to the underlying data.
            For example, a graphical representation about the data on a CSV file may not contain the same total information recorded in the CSV file, but they could be considered as two distributions for the same dataset as they are about the same data.
            As a counter-example, budget data for different years would usually be modelled as different datasets, each with their own distributions, since all distributions of one dataset should broadly contain the same data.
            Nevertheless, the question of whether different representations can be understood to be distributions of the same dataset is use-case specific, so the judgement about how to describe them is the responsibility of the provider. </p>

<section id="dereferenceable-identifiers" class="informative">
<h2>Dereferenceable Identifiers</h2>

    <p>The scientific and data provider communities use a number of different identifiers for publications, authors and data. DCAT primarily relies on persistent HTTP URIs as an effective way of making identifiers actionable. Notably, quite a few identifier schemes can be encoded as dereferenceable HTTP URIs, and some of them are also returning machine-readable metadata (e.g., <abbr title="Digital Object Identifier">DOIs</abbr> [[?ISO-26324]] and <a href="https://orcid.org/"><abbr title="Open Researcher and Contributor ID">ORCIDs</abbr></a>). Regardless, data providers still might need to refer to legacy identifiers, non-HTTP dereferenceable identifiers, locally minted or third-party-provided identifiers. In these cases, [[?DCTERMS]] and [[?VOCAB-ADMS]] can be of use.</p>
    <p>The property <a href="#Property:resource_identifier"><code>dct:identifier</code></a> explicitly indicates HTTP URIs as well as legacy identifiers. In the following examples,  <a href="#Property:resource_identifier"><code>dct:identifier</code></a> identifies a dataset, but it can similarly be used with any kind of resources.</p>

<pre id="ex-identifier" class="example nohighlight turtle">
&lt;https://example.org/id&gt; a dcat:Dataset;
	dct:identifier "https://example.org/id"^^xsd:anyURI
  .</pre>

    <p> Proxy dereferenceable URIs can be used when resources have not HTTP dereferenceable IDs. For example, in the following example, <code>https://example.org/proxyid</code> is a proxy for <code>id</code>.</p>

<pre id="ex-proxy-id" class="example nohighlight turtle">
&lt;https://example.org/proxyid&gt; a dcat:Dataset;
	dct:identifier  "id"^^xsd:string
    .</pre>
    <p>The property <a data-cite="VOCAB-ADMS#adms-identifier"><code>adms:identifier</code></a> [[?VOCAB-ADMS]] can express other locally minted identifiers or external identifiers, like DOI, <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli-register/about.html"><abbr title="European Legislation Identifier">ELI</abbr></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/">ar&Chi;iv</a> for creative works and <a href="https://orcid.org/">ORCID</a>, <a href="https://viaf.org/"><abbr title="Virtual International Authority File">VIAF</abbr></a>, <a href="http://www.isni.org/"><abbr title="International Standard Name Identifier">ISNI</abbr></a> for actors such as authors and publishers, as long as the identifiers are globally unique and stable.</p>
    <p>The following example uses <a data-cite="VOCAB-ADMS#schemaAgency"><code>adms:schemaAgency</code></a> and <a data-cite="?DCTERMS#creator"><code>dct:creator</code></a> to represent the authority that defines the identifier scheme (e.g., the <a href="https://www.doi.org/">DOI foundation</a> in the example), <code>adms:schemaAgency</code> is used when the authority has no URI associated. The <a href="https://www.crossref.org/display-guidelines/">CrossRef</a> and <a href="https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-doi-display-guidelines">DataCite</a> display guidelines recommend displaying DOIs as full URL link in the form <code>https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxxx/</code>.
    </p>

<pre id="ex-adms-identifier" class="example nohighlight turtle">
&lt;https://example.org/id&gt; a dcat:Dataset;
   adms:identifier  &lt;https://example.org/iddoi&gt; ;
   dct:publisher &lt;https://example.org/PoelenJorritH&gt;.

&lt;https://example.org/iddoi&gt; a adms:Identifier ;
   # reading https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#notations more than one skos:notation can be set
   skos:notation "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1486279"^^xsd:anyURI;
   # the authority/agency defining the identifier scheme, used if the agency has no URI
   adms:schemaAgency "International DOI Foundation" ;
   # the authority/agency defining the identifier scheme, used if the agency has URI
   dct:creator  ex:InternationalDOIFundation .

ex:InternationalDOIFundation a foaf:Organization ;
    rdfs:label "International DOI Foundation";
    foaf:homepage &lt;https://www.doi.org/&gt; .

&lt;https://example.org/PoelenJorritH&gt; a foaf:Person;
    foaf:name "Jorrit H. Poelen" ;
    adms:identifier &lt;https://example.org/PoelenJorritHID&gt; .

&lt;https://example.org/PoelenJorritHID&gt; a adms:Identifier;
   skos:notation "https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3138-4118"^^xsd:anyURI ;
   # the authority/agency defining the identifier scheme, used if the agency has no URI
   adms:schemaAgency "ORCID" .
</pre>

    <p> The example does not represent the authority responsible for assigning and maintaining identifiers using that scheme (e.g., <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>) as naming the registrant goes against the philosophy of DOI, where the sub-spaces are abstracted from the organisation that registers them, with the advantage that DOIs do not change when the organization changes or the responsibility for that sub-space is handed over to someone else. The example shows a locally minted identifier for the creator of the dataset (e.g., <code>https://example.org/PoelenJorritHID</code>) and its correspondent ORCID identifier (e.g., <code>https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3138-4118</code>). </p>
    <p>When the HTTP dereferenceable ID returns an RDF/OWL description for the dataset, the use of <code>owl:sameAs</code> might be considered. For example,</p>

<pre id="ex-owl-sameas" class="example nohighlight turtle">
&lt;https://example.org/id&gt; a dcat:Dataset;
	...
	owl:sameAs &lt;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1486279&gt; .
</pre>
    <p>when dereferenced with media type <code>text/turtle</code>,  <code>https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1486279</code> returns a [[?SCHEMA-ORG]] description for the dataset, which might dynamically enrich the description provided by <code>https://example.org/id</code>. </p>

<aside class="note">
    <p>Identifiers for datasets should follow the [[?DWBP]] <a data-cite="?DWBP#DataIdentifiers">Data Identifiers Best Practice</a>.</p>
</aside>

    <p>The need to distinguish between primary and alternative (or legacy) identifiers for a dataset within DCAT has been posed as a requirement. However, it is very much application-specific and would be better addressed in application profiles rather than mandating a general approach.</p>

    <p>Depending on the application context, specific guidelines such as <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/release/dcat-ap-how-manage-duplicates">"DCAT-AP: How to manage duplicates?"</a> can be adopted for distinguishing authoritative datasets from dataset harvested by third parties catalogs.</p>

    <section id="identifiers-type">
    <h2>Indicating common identifier types</h2>

        <p> If identifiers are not HTTP dereferenceable, common identifier types can be served as <a data-cite="?RDF11-CONCEPTS#dfn-recognized-datatype-iris">RDF datatypes</a> [[?RDF11-CONCEPTS]] or custom <a data-cite="?OWL2-SYNTAX#Datatype_Definitions">OWL datatypes</a> [[OWL2-SYNTAX]] for the sake of interoperability, see <code>ex:type</code> in the following example.</p>

<pre id="ex-identifier-type" class="example nohighlight turtle">
&lt;https://example.org/id&gt; a dcat:Dataset;
	...
	adms:identifier &lt;https://example.org/sid&gt; .

 &lt;https://example.org/sid&gt; rdf:type adms:Identifier ;
 # the actual id
	 skos:notation "PA 1-060-815"^^ex:type ;
 # Human readable schema agency
	 adms:schemaAgency "US Copyright Office" ;
	 dcterms:issued "2001-09-12"^^xsd:date .
</pre>

        <p>If a registered URI type is used (following [[?RFC3986]], <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>), the identifier scheme is part of the URI; thus indicating a separate identifier scheme in 'type' is redundant. For example, DOI is registered as a namespace in the <code>info</code> URI scheme [[IANA-URI-SCHEMES]] (see <a href="https://www.doi.org/faq.html">DOI FAQ #11</a>), so according to [[?RFC3986]], it should be encoded as in the following</p>

<pre id="ex-identifier-type-in-uri" class="example nohighlight turtle">&lt;https://example.org/sid&gt; rdf:type adms:Identifier ;
 # the actual id
	 skos:notation "info:doi/10.1109/5.771073"^^xsd:anyURI
 .
</pre>

        <p>Otherwise, examples of common types for identifier scheme (<a href="https://arxiv.org/help/arxiv_identifier">arXiv</a>, etc.) are defined in <a href="https://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-4.1/include/datacite-relatedIdentifierType-v4.xsd">DataCite schema</a> and <a href="https://fairsharing.org/standards/?q=&selected_facets=type_exact:identifier%20schema">FAIRsharing Registry</a>.</p>

    <h2>Quality information</h2>
    <aside class="note">
      <p>This section is non-normative as it provides guidance on how to document the quality of DCAT
      first class entities (e.g., datasets, distributions) and it does not define new DCAT terms. The guidance relies on the
      Data Quality Vocabulary (DQV) [[?VOCAB-DQV]], which is a W3C Group Note.</p>
    </aside>

    <p>The Data Quality Vocabulary (DQV) [[?VOCAB-DQV]] offers common modelling patterns for different aspects of Data
    Quality.
    It can relate  DCAT datasets and distributions with different types of quality information including:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dqv/#dqv:QualityAnnotation"><code>dqv:QualityAnnotation</code></a>, which represents feedback and quality certificates given about the dataset or its distribution.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dqv/#dqv:QualityPolicy"><code>dqv:QualityPolicy</code></a>, which represents a policy or agreement that is chiefly governed by data quality concerns.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dqv/#dqv:QualityMeasurement"><code>dqv:QualityMeasurement</code></a>, which represents a metric value providing quantitative or qualitative information about the dataset or distribution.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each type of quality information can pertain to one or more quality dimensions, namely, quality characteristics relevant
    to the consumer. The practice to see the quality as a multi-dimensional space is consolidated in the field of quality
    management to split the quality management into addressable chunks. DQV does not define a normative list of quality
    dimensions. It offers the quality dimensions proposed in ISO/IEC 25012 [[?ISO-IEC-25012]] and [[?ZaveriEtAl]]
    as two possible starting points. It also provides an <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ldqd">RDF representation</a>
    for the quality dimensions and categories defined in the latter. Ultimately, implementers will need to choose themselves
    the collection of quality dimensions that best fits their needs.
    The following section shows how DCAT and DQV can be coupled to describe the quality of datasets and distributions.
    For a comprehensive introduction  and further examples of use, please refer to [[?VOCAB-DQV]].</p>

    <aside class="note">
        <p>The following examples make no comments on where the quality information would reside and how it is managed. That
	is out of scope for the DCAT vocabulary.  The assumption made is that the quality individuals are available using
	the URIs indicated.
        Besides, the examples and more in general the [[?VOCAB-DQV]]  is neutral to the data portal design choices on how to collect
	quality information. For example, data portals can collect [[?VOCAB-DQV]] instances by implementing specific UI to annotate
	data or by taking inputs from 3rd-party services.

            <h3>Degree of conformance</h3>
            <p>Some legal context requires to specify the degree of conformance. For example, INSPIRE metadata adopts a
	    specific controlled vocabulary [[?INSPIRE-DoC]]
	    to express non-conformance and non-evaluation beside the full compliance. Similar controlled vocabularies can
	    be defined in other contexts.</p>
	    <p>The following example specifies some newly minted concepts representing the degree of conformance (i.e., conformant, not conformant) and  declares the
	    <a data-cite="?DCTERMS#terms-type"><code>dct:type</code></a> for indicating
	    the result of conformance test. Following a pattern used in [[?GeoDCAT-AP]], the example uses a <code>prov:Entity</code> to model the  conformance test (e.g.,
	    <code>a:testResult</code>), a <code>prov:Activity</code> to model the testing activity (e.g.,
	    <code>a:testingActivity</code>), a <code>prov:Plan</code> derived from the Data on the Web Best Practices [[?DWBP]] (e.g., <code>a:conformanceTest</code>) to check for the whole set of best practices. A qualified PROV association binds the testing activity to the conformance test.</p>
	    <aside class="note">
	    <p>Depending of the kind of dataset, other best practices and standards, such as the FAIR Principles [[?FAIR]] or the Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices [[?SDW-BP]], can be considered as a replacement or used in combination with [[?DWBP]].</p>

  <h2>Qualified Relations</h2>

  <p>
    DCAT includes elements to support description of many aspects of datasets and data-services. Nevertheless, additional information is required in order to fully express the semantics of some relationships. An example is that, while [[!DCTERMS]] provides the standard roles <b>creator</b>, <b>contributor</b> and <b>publisher</b> for attribution of a resource to a responsible party or agent, there are many other potential roles, see for example the <code>CI_RoleCode</code> values from [[?ISO-19115-1]]. Similarly, while [[!DCTERMS]] and [[!PROV-O]] provide some properties to capture relationships between resources, including <b>was derived from</b>, <b>was quoted from</b>, <b>is version of</b>, <b>references</b> and several others, many additional concerns are seen in the list of [[?ISO-19115-1]] <a href="http://registry.it.csiro.au/def/isotc211/DS_AssociationTypeCode"><code>DS_AssociationTypeCodes</code></a>, the IANA Registry of Link Relations [[?IANA-RELATIONS]], the DataCite metadata schema [[?DataCite]]
    and the <a href="https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators">MARC relators</a>. While these relations could be captured with additional sub-properties of <code>dct:relation</code>, <code>dct:contributor</code>, etc, this would lead to an explosion in the number of properties, and anyway the full set of potential roles and relationships is unknown.
  </p>
  <p>
    A common approach for meeting these kinds of requirement is to introduce an additional resource to carry parameters that qualify the relationship. Precedents are the <a data-cite="?PROV-O#description-qualified-terms">qualified terms</a> in [[?PROV-O]] and the <a data-cite="?VOCAB-SSN#Sample_Relations">sample relations</a> in the Semantic Sensor Network ontology [[?VOCAB-SSN]]. The general <a href="http://patterns.dataincubator.org/book/qualified-relation.html">Qualified Relation pattern</a> is described in [[?LinkedDataPatterns]].
  </p>
  <p>
    Many of the qualified terms from [[!PROV-O]] are relevant to the description of resources in catalogs but these are incomplete due to the activity-centric viewpoint taken by PROV-O. Addressing some of the gaps, additional forms are included in the DCAT vocabulary to satisfy requirements that do not involve explicit activities. These are summarized in the <a href="#UML-DCAT-Qualified-Relations"></a>:
  </p>

  <figure id="UML-DCAT-Qualified-Relations"><img alt="UML model of DCAT qualified relationships" src="UML/DCAT-Relationships.png">
      <figcaption>
          Qualified relationships support an extensible set of roles relating resources to agents or to other resources
      </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Note that, while the focus of these qualified forms is to allow for additional <i>roles</i> on a relationship, other aspect of the relationships, such as the applicable time interval, are easily attached when a specific node is used to describe the relationship like this (e.g. see the <a data-cite="?PROV-O#qualified-terms-figure">chart of Influence relations</a> in [[?PROV-O]] for some examples).
  </p>
  <p class="note">
    Because of the global domain constraints on <a data-cite="?PROV-O#qualifiedAttribution">prov:qualifiedAttribution</a> and the super-property of <a href="#Property:resource_qualifiedRelation">dcat:qualifiedRelation</a>, use of the qualified forms entail that the context resources is a member of the class <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#Entity">prov:Entity</a> [[RDF-SCHEMA]] .
  </p>


<section id="qualified-attribution">
  <h3>Relationships between datasets and agents</h3>
  <p>
    The standard [[!DCTERMS]] properties <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/contributor"><code>dct:contributor</code></a>, <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator"><code>dct:creator</code></a> and <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/publisher"><code>dct:publisher</code></a>, and the generic <a data-cite="?PROV-O#wasAttributedTo"><code>prov:wasAttributedTo</code></a> from [[!PROV-O]], support basic associations of responsible agents with a catalogued resource.
    However, there are many other roles of importance in relation to datasets and services - e.g. funder, distributor, custodian, editor.
    Some of these roles are enumerated in the <code>CI_RoleCode</code> values from [[?ISO-19115-1]], in the [[?DataCite]] metadata schema, and included within the <a href="https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators">MARC relators</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A general method for assigning an agent to a resource with a specified role is provided by using the qualified form <a data-cite="?PROV-O#qualifiedAttribution"><code>prov:qualifiedAttribution</code></a> from [[!PROV-O]].
    The following provides an illustration:
  </p>
<pre id="ex-qualified-attribution" class="example nohighlight turtle">
ex:DS987
  a dcat:Dataset ;
  prov:qualifiedAttribution [
    a prov:Attribution ;
    prov:agent &lt;https://www.ala.org.au/&gt; ;

  ] ;
  prov:qualifiedAttribution [
    a prov:Attribution ;
    prov:agent &lt;https://www.education.gov.au/&gt; ;
    dcat:hadRole &lt;http://registry.it.csiro.au/def/isotc211/CI_RoleCode/funder&gt;
  ] ;
.
</pre>

<p>
  In this example the roles are taken from [[?ISO-19115-1]] which are available as linked data in a <a href="http://registry.it.csiro.au/def/isotc211/CI_RoleCode">code list</a>.
</p>

<aside class="note">
<p>The domain of <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#hadRole"><code>prov:hadRole</code></a> property is <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#Association"><code>prov:Association</code></a>, i.e. PROV-O roles relate to activities, not entities [[!PROV-O]].
  Therefore, a new property <a href="#Property:relationship_hadRole"><code>dcat:hadRole</code></a> is used to attach a specific role to the association-class <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#Attribution"><code>prov:Attribution</code></a>.</p>

    support the description of relationships between datasets and other catalogued resources.    
    However, there are many other relationships of importance - e.g. alternate, canonical, original, preview, stereo-mate, working-copy-of.
    Some of these roles are enumerated in the <code>DS_AssociationTypeCode</code> values from [[?ISO-19115-1]], the IANA Registry of Link Relations [[?IANA-RELATIONS]], in the [[?DataCite]] metadata schema, and included within the <a href="https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators">MARC relators</a>.
  <p>
  <p>
    A general method for relating a resource to another resource with a specified role is provided by using the qualified form <a href="#Property:resource_qualifiedRelation"><code>dcat:qualifiedRelation</code></a>.
    The following provides illustrations:

<pre id="ex-dataset-resource" class="example nohighlight turtle">

    <h2>License and Rights Statements</h2>

	<p class="note">
		DCAT 2014 handling of license and rights do not appear to satisfy all requirements [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]].
		The recently completed W3C ODRL vocabulary [[!ODRL-VOCAB]] provides a rich language for describing many kinds of rights and obligations.
		In this chapter, we describe some patterns for linking DCAT Datasets and/or Distributions to suitable license and rights expressions.
	</p>

	<p>
		Selecting the right way to express conditions for access to and re-use of resources can be complex.
		Implementers should always seek legal advice before deciding which conditions apply to the resource being described.
	</p>

	<p>
    This specification distinguishes three main situations:
    one where a statement is associated with a resource that is explicitly declared as a 'license';
    a second, where the statement is associated with a resource denoting only access rights;
    a third, covering all the other cases - i.e., statements not concerning licensing conditions and/or access rights (e.g., copyright statements).
	</p>

	<p class="note">
	  The provision of licensing conditions and access rights complies with the Best Practices 4 ("<a data-cite="DWBP#licenses">Provide data license information</a>") and 22 ("<a data-cite="DWBP#DataUnavailabilityReference">Provide an explanation for data that is not available</a>"), respectively, from [[DWBP]].
	</p>

	<p>
		To address these scenarios, it is recommended to use the property <code>dct:rights</code>, and its sub-properties <code>dct:license</code> and <code>dct:accessRights</code>. More precisely:
  </p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			  <p>use <a data-cite="?DCTERMS#terms-license"><code>dct:license</code></a> to refer to licenses;</p>

        <p class="note">
          For interoperability, it is recommended to use canonical URIs of well-known licenses such as <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/">those defined by Creative Commons</a>.
        </p>
			</li>
			<li>
			  <p>use <a data-cite="?DCTERMS#terms-accessRights"><code>dct:accessRights</code></a>  to express statements concerning only access rights (e.g., whether data can be accessed by anyone or just by authorized parties);</p>

        <p class="note">
          Access rights can also be expressed as code lists / taxonomies. Examples include the access rights code list  [[?MDR-AR]] used in [[?DCAT-AP]] and the <a href="http://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/">Eprints Access Rights Vocabulary Encoding Scheme</a>.
        </p>
      </li>
			<li>
			  <p>use <a data-cite="?DCTERMS#terms-rights"><code>dct:rights</code></a> for all the other types of rights statements - those which are not covered by <code>dct:license</code> and <code>dct:accessRights</code>, such as copyright statements.</p>

			  <p class="note">
			    A more sophisticated approach to express rights, based on and extending [[?DCTERMS]], is provided by the Open Data Rights Statement Vocabulary (ODRS) [[?ODRS]], which defines properties for specifying, among others, copyright statements and copyright notices.
			  </p>
			</li>
		</ol>

	<p>Finally, in the particular case when rights are expressed via <a data-cite="?ODRL-VOCAB#term-Policy">ODRL policies</a>, it is recommended to use use the <a data-cite="?ODRL-VOCAB#term-hasPolicy"><code>odrl:hasPolicy</code></a> property as the link from the description of the catalogued resource or distribution to the ODRL policy, in addition to the relevant <code>dct</code> property.</p>
  <p class="note">The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) [[!ODRL-VOCAB]] is a policy expression language that provides a flexible and interoperable information model, vocabulary, and encoding mechanisms for representing statements about usage (i.e. permissions, prohibitions, and obligations) of content and services.</p>

  <p>Recommendations on the use of these properties on the different types of resources defined in DCAT are provided in the relevant class descriptions.</p>

<section id="dataset-versions">
    <h2>Versioning</h2>
<p>Versioning can be applied to any of the first class citizens DCAT resources including Catalogs, Datasets, Distributions. The notion of version is very much related to the community practices,  data management policy and the workflows in place. It is up to data providers to decide when and why a new version should be released. For this reason, DCAT refrains from providing definitions or rules about when changes in a resource should turn in a new release of it. </p>

<p>Versioning may be understood as involving relationships between datasets, which is supported by the <a href="#Property:resource_qualifiedRelation"><code>dcat:qualifiedRelation</code></a> and described in the section <a href="#qualified-relationship"></a>. The class <a href="#Class:Relationship"><code>dcat:Relationship</code></a> supports providing information about the relationship, and could be extended for versioning information.</p>  

    <p class="note">
        In this chapter it is planned to describe some patterns for describing Dataset and/or Distribution versions.

    <h2>Data Citation</h2>

    <p>
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#RDSC">Dataset citation</a> is one of the requirements identified for this DCAT revision.
        Data citation is the practice of referencing data in a similar way as when providing bibliographic references, acknowledging data
        as a first class output in any investigative process. Data citation offers multiple benefits, such as supporting proper attribution
        and credit to those producing the data, facilitating data discovery, supporting tracking the impact and reuse of data, allowing for
        collaboration and re-use of data, and enabling the reproducibility of results based on the data.
    </p>

    <p>
        To support data citation, the dataset description should include at a minimum: the dataset identifier, the dataset creator(s), the dataset title,
        the dataset publisher and the dataset publication or release date. These elements are those required by the DataCite metadata schema [[?DataCite]],
        which is the metadata associated by the persistent identifiers (Digital Object Identifiers or DOIs) assigned by [[?DataCite]] to research data.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to support data citation, this DCAT revision has added the consideration of <a href="#dereferenceable-identifiers"></a> and support for indicating
        <a href="#Property:resource_creator">the creators of the catalogued resources</a>. The remaining properties necessary for data citation were already available in DCAT 2014 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]].
    </p>

    <p>
        The constraints on the availability of properties required for data citation in the dataset description can be represented as a DCAT data citation profile.

<section id="profiles">

    <h2>DCAT Profiles</h2>

    <p>
        The DCAT-2014 vocabulary [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] has been extended for application in data catalogues in different domains.
        Each of these new specifications constitutes a DCAT profile, i.e. a named set of constraints based on DCAT. In some cases,
        an application profile extends one of the DCAT extensions themselves.

<section id="security_and_privacy">
    <h2>Security and Privacy</h2>
    <p>
    The DCAT vocabulary supports the attribution of data and metadata to various participants such as resource <a href="#Property:resource_creator">creators</a>, <a href="#Property:resource_publisher">publishers</a> and other parties or agents via <a href="#qualified-forms"></a>,
	    and as such defines terms that may be related to personal information.  In addition, it also supports the association of <a href="#Property:resource_rights">rights</a> and <a href="#Property:resource_license">licenses</a> with cataloged Resources and Distributions.
	    These rights and licences could potentially include or reference sensitive information such as user and asset identifiers as <a data-cite="?ODRL-VOCAB#privacy-consideration">described</a> in [[!ODRL-VOCAB]].   Implementations that produce, maintain, publish or

    <h2>Relation to other W3C Recommendations</h2>

    <p class="issue" data-number="254">
        DCAT should be aligned with other recent Linked Data based Recommendations.
    </p>

    <section id="ldp" class="informative">
        <h3>Linked Data Platform (<abbr title="Linked Data Platform">LDP</abbr>)</h3>

        <p>
            DCAT provides a data model for representation of metadata about datasets in the form of Linked Data, but it does not specify how this metadata can be accessed or modified.
            The DCAT compatible metadata can be viewed as collections of Catalog Records, Datasets and Data Services contained in a Catalog, and a collection of Distributions contained in a Dataset.
            The Linked Data Platform [[?LDP]] specification deals with access to and modification of Linked Data Platform Containers (<abbr title="Linked Data Platform Containers">LDPCs</abbr>).
            This section provides guidance on how to represent DCAT metadata as LDP Containers, which supports namely the implementation of <a href="https://solid.mit.edu/" title="Solid">Solid</a> based DCAT catalogs.
        </p>

        <p>
            First, we will present an example of a LDPC for datasets in a catalog.
            There is one catalog with one dataset.
            The dataset is contained in the <code>&lt;/datasets/&gt;</code> LDP Direct Container.
            To ensure the <abbr title="Linked Data Platform Container">LDPC</abbr> discovery, we connect it to the Catalog using the <code>dcat-ldp:datasets</code> predicate.
        </p>
<pre id="ex-ldpc-dataset" class="example nohighlight turtle">
@prefix dcat: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#&gt; .
@prefix ldp:  &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#&gt; .
@prefix dcat-ldp:  &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat-ldp#&gt; .

@base &lt;https://example.org/resource/catalog&gt; .

&lt;&gt; a dcat:Catalog ;
	dcat-ldp:datasets &lt;/datasets/&gt; ;
	dcat:dataset &lt;/datasets/001&gt; .

&lt;/datasets/&gt; a ldp:Container, ldp:DirectContainer ;
	ldp:membershipResource &lt;&gt; ;
	ldp:hasMemberRelation dcat:dataset ;
	ldp:contains &lt;/datasets/001&gt; .

&lt;/datasets/001&gt; a dcat:Dataset .</pre>

        <p>In the second example, we add LDPCs <code>&lt;/records/&gt;</code> for Catalog Records and <code>&lt;/services/&gt;</code> for Data Services, discoverable using <code>dcat-ldp:records</code> and <code>dcat-ldp:services</code> predicates from the Catalog:
        </p>
<pre id="ex-ldpc-record" class="example nohighlight turtle">
@prefix dcat: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#&gt; .
@prefix ldp:  &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#&gt; .
@prefix dcat-ldp:  &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat-ldp#&gt; .

@base &lt;https://example.org/resource/catalog&gt; .

&lt;&gt; a dcat:Catalog ;
	dcat-ldp:records &lt;/records/&gt; ;
	dcat-ldp:datasets &lt;/datasets/&gt; ;
	dcat-ldp:services &lt;/services/&gt; ;
	dcat:dataset &lt;/datasets/001&gt; .

&lt;/records/&gt; a ldp:Container, ldp:DirectContainer ;
	ldp:membershipResource &lt;&gt; ;
	ldp:hasMemberRelation dcat:record ;
	ldp:contains &lt;/records/001&gt; .

&lt;/datasets/&gt; a ldp:Container, ldp:DirectContainer ;
	ldp:membershipResource &lt;&gt; ;
	ldp:hasMemberRelation dcat:dataset ;
	ldp:contains &lt;/datasets/001&gt; .

&lt;/services/&gt; a ldp:Container, ldp:DirectContainer ;
	ldp:membershipResource &lt;&gt; ;
	ldp:hasMemberRelation dcat:service ;
	ldp:contains &lt;/services/001&gt; .

&lt;/records/001&gt; a dcat:CatalogRecord ;
	foaf:primaryTopic &lt;/datasets/001&gt; .

&lt;/datasets/001&gt; a dcat:Dataset ;

&lt;/services/001&gt; a dcat:DataService .</pre>

        <p>Each dataset has its own LDPC for its distributions.
            In the third example, we show the LDPC <code>&lt;/datasets/001/distributions/&gt;</code> for distributions of a single dataset, <code>&lt;/datasets/001&gt;</code>, discoverable through the <code>dcat-ldp:distributions</code> predicate.</p>
<pre id="ex-ldpc-distribution" class="example nohighlight turtle">

@prefix dcat: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#&gt; .
@prefix ldp:  &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#&gt; .
@prefix dcat-ldp:  &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat-ldp#&gt; .

@base &lt;https://example.org/resource/catalog&gt; .

&lt;/datasets/001&gt; a dcat:Dataset ;
	dcat-ldp:distributions &lt;/datasets/001/distributions/&gt; ;
	dcat:distribution &lt;/datasets/001/distributions/001&gt; .

&lt;/datasets/001/distributions/&gt; a ldp:Container, ldp:DirectContainer ;
	ldp:membershipResource &lt;/datasets/001&gt; ;
	ldp:hasMemberRelation dcat:distribution ;
	ldp:contains &lt;/datasets/001/distributions/001&gt; .

&lt;/datasets/001/distributions/001&gt; a dcat:Distribution .</pre>

        <p class="note">For catalogs with many datasets, catalog records, data services or distributions,
            the Linked Data Platform Paging mechanism [[?LDP-Paging]] SHOULD be used to provide access to them.</p>

            In the next sections we formally define the additional properties used for discovery of LDP containers.

            Schema.org [[?SCHEMA-ORG]] includes a number of types and properties based on the original DCAT work (see <a href="https://schema.org/Dataset">sdo:Dataset</a> as a starting point),
            and the index for Google's <a href="https://g.co/datasetsearch">Dataset Search service</a> relies on structured description in web pages about datasets using both

        <p>
            General purpose web search services that use metadata at all rely primarily on [[?SCHEMA-ORG]], so the relationship of DCAT to [[?SCHEMA-ORG]] is of interest for data providers and catalog publishers who wish their datasets and services to be exposed through those indexes.

        <p>
            A <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/Datasets">mapping between DCAT 2014 and schema.org</a> was discussed on the original proposal to extend [[?SCHEMA-ORG]] for describing datasets and data catalogs.
            Partial mappings between DCAT 2014 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] and [[?SCHEMA-ORG]] were provided earlier by the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/wiki/ISO_19115_-_DCAT_-_Schema.org_mapping">Spatial Data on the Web Working Group</a>, building upon previous work.
        </p>
        <p>
            A recommended mapping from the revised DCAT (this document) to [[?SCHEMA-ORG]] version 3.4 is <a href="https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/dcat/rdf/dcat-schema.ttl">available in an RDF file</a>.
            This mapping is axiomatized using the predicates <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code>, <code>rdfs:subPropertyOf</code>, <code>owl:equivalentClass</code>, <code>owl:equivalentProperty</code>, <code>skos:closeMatch</code>,
            and also using the annotation properties <code>sdo:domainIncludes</code> and <code>sdo:rangeIncludes</code> to match [[?SCHEMA-ORG]] semantics. The alignment is summarized in the table below, considering the prefix <code>sdo</code> as <code>http://schema.org/</code>.

      <h3>Loosely structured catalog</h3>

      <p class="note">
          The background to this example is discussed in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/253">Best practice for a loosely-structured catalog</a>
      </p>

      <p>
          In many legacy catalogues and repositories (e.g. CKAN), ‘datasets’ are ‘just a bag of files’. There is no distinction made between part/whole, distribution (representation), and other kinds of relationship (e.g. documentation, schema, supporting documents) from the dataset to each of the files.
      </p>
      <p>
          If the nature of the relationships between a dataset and component resources in a catalogue, repository, or elsewhere are not known, <code>dct:relation</code> can be used:

      <h3>Dataset provenance</h3>
      <p>
          The provenance or business context of a dataset can be described using elements from the W3C Provenance Ontology [[?PROV-O]].
      </p>
      <p>
          For example, a simple link from a dataset description to the project that generated the dataset can be formalized as follows (other details elided for clarity):

      <p>
          This example is available from the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/tree/gh-pages/dcat/examples">DXWG code repository</a> at <a href="https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/dcat/examples/csiro-dap-examples.ttl"><code>csiro-dap-examples.ttl</code></a>.
      </p>
      <p>
          Several properties capture provenance information, including within the citation and title, but the primary link to a formal description of the project is through <a href="#Property:dataset_wasgeneratedby"><code>prov:wasGeneratedBy</code></a>.
          A terse description of the project is shown as a <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#Activity"><code>prov:Activity</code></a>, though this would not necessarily be part of the same catalog.
          Note that as the project is ongoing, the activity has no end date.
      </p>
      <p>
          Further provenance information might be provided using the other <i>starting point properties</i> from PROV, in particular <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#wasAttributedTo"><code>prov:wasAttributedTo</code></a> (to link to an agent associated with the dataset production) and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#wasDerivedFrom"><code>prov:wasDerivedFrom</code></a> (to link to a predecessor dataset). Both of these complement Dublin Core properties already used in DCAT, as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              <code>prov:wasAttributedTo</code> provides a general link to all kinds of associated agents, such as project sponsors, managers, dataset owners, etc which are not correctly characterized using <code>dct:creator</code>, <code>dct:contributor</code> or <code>dct:publisher</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
              <code>prov:wasDerivedFrom</code> supports a more specific relationship to an input or predecessor dataset compared with <code>dct:source</code>, which is not necessarily a previous dataset.
          </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          Further patterns for the use of <i>qualified properties</i> for resource attribution and interrelationships are described in  <a href="#qualified-forms"></a>.

          Data services may be described using DCAT.
          The values of the classifiers <code>dct:type</code>, <code>dct:conformsTo</code>, and <code>dcat:endpointDescription</code> provide progressively more detail about a service, whose actual endpoint is given by the <code>dcat:endpointURL</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
          The first example describes a data catalog hosted by the European Environment Agency (EEA).
          This is classified as a <a href="#Class:Data_Service"><code>dcat:DataService</code></a> and has the <code>dct:type</code> set to &quot;<a href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/SpatialDataServiceType/discovery">discovery</a>&quot; from the INSPIRE classification of spatial data service types [[?INSPIRE-SDST]].

        <h3>Changes since the W3C Recommendation of 16 January 2014</h3>
        <p>The document has undergone the following changes since the W3C Recommendation of 16 January 2014 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]]:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
              A new property <a href="#Property:dataset_spatialresolution"><code>dcat:spatialResolutionInMeters</code></a> added to support description of the spatial resolution of datasets and distributions. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/84">Issue #84</a>
          </li>

          <li>
              A new property <a href="#Property:dataset_temporalresolution"><code>dcat:temporalResolution</code></a> added to support description of the temporal resolution of datasets and distributions. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/84">Issue #84</a>
          </li>

          <li>
              Two new properties were added to specify packaged and compressed distributions: <a href="#Property:distribution_packaging_format"><code>dcat:packageFormat</code></a> and <a href="#Property:distribution_compression_format"><code>dcat:compressFormat</code></a>. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/54">Issue #54</a>
          </li>
          <li>
              A new section <a href="#qualified-relationship"></a>, a new property <a href="#Property:resource_qualifiedRelation"><code>dcat:qualifiedRelation</code></a> and a new class <a href="#Class:Relationship"><code>dcat:Relationship</code></a> added to support relationships between datasets or other resources. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/79">Issue #79</a>
          </li>

          <li>
                A new  section <a href="#dereferenceable-identifiers"></a> was added to describe how to indicate different types of identifiers by using [[!DCTERMS]] and [[?VOCAB-ADMS]] - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/53">Issue #53</a> and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/68">Issue #68</a>.
            </li>

            <li>
                A new section on <a href="#qualified-attribution"></a> was added to recommend a pattern for assigning an agent to a catalogued resource with a qualified relationship.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="#Property:relationship_hadRole">Property: had role</a>: The property <code>dcat:hadRole</code> is added to support the use of <a data-cite="?PROV-O#qualifiedAttribution"><code>prov:qualifiedAttribution</code></a> to associate an agent with a DCAT resource, where the role of the agent with relation to the resource is specified, and is something other than the standard Dublin Core roles: creator, publisher or contributor - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/79">Issue #79</a>
            </li>

            <li>
               The section <a href="#license-rights"></a> was added to describe patterns for linking <code>dcat:Datasets</code> and <code>dcat:Distribution</code>s to the relevant license and rights expressions.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="#Property:resource_creator">Property: resource creator</a>: The property <code>dct:creator</code> is recommended for use in the context of a dataset or other resource to allow the entity responsible for generating the resource to be recorded - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/61">Issue #61</a>
            </li>


            <li>
                <a href="#Property:dataset_wasgeneratedby">Property: was generated by</a>: The property <code>prov:wasGeneratedBy</code> is recommended for use in the context of a dataset to allow the provenance or business context to be recorded - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/71">Issue #71</a>
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="#Property:resource_relation">Property: resource relation</a>: The property <code>dct:relation</code> is recommended for use in the context of a catalogued resource to capture general relationships, including the case where the package of resources associated with a catalogued item includes a mixture of representations, parts, documentation and other elements which are not strictly 'distributions' of a dataset - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/253">Issue #253</a>.  The more general use of <code>dct:relation</code> is driven by the requirement documented in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/81">Issue #81</a>.
            </li>


            <li>
                <a href="#Property:distribution_media_type">Property: media type</a>: The range of <code>dcat:mediaType</code> has been tightened from <code>dct:MediaTypeOrExtent</code> to <code>dct:MediaType</code> - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/127">Issue #127</a>.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="#Property:distribution_conformsto">Property: conforms to</a>: The property <code>dct:conformsTo</code> is recommended for use in the context of a <code>dcat:Distribution</code> to allow the model or schema used for the representation to be indicated as well as the serialization (which is indicated using <code>dct:format</code> and <code>dcat:mediaType</code>) - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/55">Issue #55</a>.
            </li>

            <li>
                Errors in examples of <a href="#Property:distribution_media_type"><code>dcat:mediaType</code></a> usage fixed - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/170">Issue #170</a>.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="#quality-information"></a>: Recommendations for how to associate quality information to datasets using elements from the W3C DQV vocabulary [[?VOCAB-DQV]] are provided. Since [[?VOCAB-DQV]] is not a rec-track document, these are non-normative - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/57">Issue #57</a> and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/58">Issue #58</a>.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="#Class:Resource">Class: Catalogued resource</a>: In DCAT 2014 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the scope of a <a href="#Class:Catalog"><code>dcat:Catalog</code></a> was limited to Datasets. This has been generalized, and properties common to all catalogued resources are now associated with a super-class <a href="#Class:Resource"><code>dcat:Resource</code></a> - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">Issue #172</a> and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/116">Issue #116</a>. The wiki page on <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/wiki/Cataloguing-data-services">Cataloguing data services</a> describes some proposals related to this requirement.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="#Class:Data_Service">Class: Data service</a>: In DCAT 2014 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the scope of a <a href="#Class:Catalog"><code>dcat:Catalog</code></a> was limited to Datasets. The new class <code>dcat:DataService</code> has been added to support cataloguing various kinds of data services - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">Issue #172</a>,  <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/56">Issue #56</a>,  <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/432">Issue #432</a>, <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/821">Issue #821</a>.
            </li>


            <li><a href="#Class:Dataset">Class: Dataset</a>:
                In DCAT 2014 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] <a href="#Class:Dataset"><code>dcat:Dataset</code></a> was a sub-class of <a href="http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Dataset"><code>dctype:Dataset</code></a>, which is a term of the <a data-cite="?DCTERMS#section-7">DCMI Types vocabulary</a> [[!DCTERMS]]. This relationship has been removed in the revised DCAT vocabulary - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/98">Issue #98</a>.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="#Class:Distribution">Class: Distribution</a>
                : In DCAT 2014 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the definition of a <a href="#Class:Distribution"><code>dcat:Distribution</code></a> allowed a number of alternative interpretations. The definition has been rephrased to clarify that distributions are primarily <i>representations</i> of datasets. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">Issue #52</a> and related use cases.
            </li>


            <li><a href="#Property:resource_theme">Property: theme/category</a>:
                In DCAT 2014 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the domain of <code>dcat:theme</code> was <code>dcat:Dataset</code>,
                which limited use of this property in other contexts. The domain has been relaxed in this revision -
                see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/123">Issue #123</a>.
            </li>

            <li><a href="#Property:resource_type">Property: type/genre</a>:
                Added in DCAT revision - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/64">Issue #64</a>, with examples of usage in overview section.
            </li>

            <li><a href="#Property:resource_keyword">Property: keyword/tag</a>:
                In DCAT 2014 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the domain of <code>dcat:keyword</code> was <code>dcat:Dataset</code>,
                which limited use of this property in other contexts. The domain has been relaxed in this revision -
                see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/121">Issue #121</a>.

                In DCAT 2014 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the domain of <code>dcat:landingPage</code> was <code>dcat:Dataset</code>,

            <li><a href="http://vocab.org/vann/#usageNote">Property: <code>vann:usageNote</code></a>:
                DCAT 2014 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] included documentation captured as text using <a href="http://vocab.org/vann/#usageNote"><code>vann:usageNote</code></a> elements,
                which is a sub-property of <code>rdfs:seeAlso</code> - an <code>owl:ObjectProperty</code> that cannot have a Literal value.
                This revision of DCAT has fixed these issues and replaced the use of <code>vann:usageNote</code> with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/#secdocumentation"><code>skos:scopeNote</code></a> -
                see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/233">Issue #233</a>.

            <li><a href="#Property:record_conformsto">Property: conforms to </a>:
                DCAT 2014 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] had no way of representing the conformance of a record metadata with a metadata standard. This revision has added the property <code>dct:conformsTo</code> for <code>dcat:CatalogRecord</code> to cover this requirement.
                - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/502">Issue #502</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                A new section <a href="#license-rights"></a> was added to provide guidance and recommendations for the use of <a data-cite="?DCTERMS#terms-license"><code>dct:license</code></a>, <a data-cite="?DCTERMS#terms-accessRights"><code>dct:accessRights</code></a>,
		and <a data-cite="?DCTERMS#terms-rights"><code>dct:rights</code></a> in the context of dcat catalogs and distributions.
		See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/114">Issue #114</a> for the background discussion.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each relevant class section was extended with properties to deal with licensing, acccess rights, other rights and policies associated with the classes, as
                recommended in <a href="#license-rights"></a>.
