<section  id="abstract">
	<p>DCAT is an RDF vocabulary designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogs published on the Web. This document defines the schema and provides examples for its use.</p>
  <p>By using DCAT to describe datasets in data catalogs, publishers are using a standard model and vocabulary that facilitates the consumption and aggregation of metadata from multiple catalogs,
		and in doing so can increase the discoverability of datasets. It also makes it possible to have a decentralized approach to publishing data catalogs and makes federated search for datasets across catalogs in multiple sites possible using the same query mechanism and structure. Aggregated DCAT metadata can serve as a manifest file as part of the digital preservation process.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">The namespace for DCAT terms is <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#</code></p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">The suggested prefix for the DCAT namespace is <code>dcat</code></p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">The (revised) DCAT vocabulary is available <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/dxwg/gh-pages/dcat/rdf/dcat.ttl">here</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="sotd">
	<p>The original DCAT vocabulary (originally hosted at http://vocab.deri.ie/dcat) was developed at the Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI), refined by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/egov/">eGov Interest Group</a>, and then finally standardized in 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/gld/">Government Linked Data (GLD)</a> Working Group.</p>
	<p>This revised version of DCAT was developed by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/">Dataset Exchange Working Group</a> in response to a new set of Use Cases and Requirements [[DCAT-UCR]] submitted on the basis of experience with the DCAT vocabulary from the time of the original version, and new applications not originally considered.</p>
  <p>DCAT incorporates terms from pre-existing vocabularies where stable terms with appropriate meanings could be found, such as foaf:homepage and dct:title.  Informal summary definitions of the externally-defined terms are included here for convenience, while authoritative definitions are available in the normative references.  Changes to definitions in the references, if any, supersede the summaries given in this specification.  Note that conformance to DCAT (Section 4) concerns usage of only the terms in the DCAT namespace itself, so possible changes to the external definitions will not affect the conformance of DCAT implementations.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p class="note">From DCAT 2014 [[!VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]]</p>

<p>Data can come in many formats, ranging from spreadsheets, through XML and RDF, to various speciality formats. DCAT does not make any assumptions about the serialisation format of the datasets described in a catalog. Other, complementary vocabularies may be used together with DCAT to provide more detailed format-specific information. For example, properties from the VoID vocabulary [[VOID]] can be used to express various statistics about a DCAT-described dataset if that dataset is in RDF format.</p>
<p>This document does not prescribe any particular method of deploying data expressed in DCAT. DCAT is applicable in many contexts including RDF accessible via SPARQL endpoints, embedded in HTML pages as RDFa, or serialized as e.g. RDF/XML or Turtle. The examples in this document use Turtle simply because of Turtle's readability.</p>
</section>

<section id="motivation" class="informative"><h2>Motivation for Change</h2>
<p>The original Recommendation [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]], published in January 2014, provided the basic framework for describing datasets. Importantly, it made the distinction between a dataset as an abstract idea and a distribution as a manifestation of the dataset. Although DCAT has been widely adopted, it has became clear that the original specification lacked a number of essential features that were added either through application profiles, such as the European Commission's DCAT-AP [[DCAT-AP]], or the development of larger vocabularies that, to a greater or lesser extent, built upon the base standard, such as the Healthcare and Life Sciences Community Profile [[HCLS-Dataset]], the Data Tag Suite [[DATS]] and more. This version of DCAT has been developed to address the specific shortcomings that have come to light through the experiences of different communities, the aim being, of course, to improve interoperability between the outputs of these larger vocabularies.</p>

</section>

<section id="namespaces-1">

<h2 >Namespaces</h2>

<p>The namespace for DCAT is <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#</code>.
	However, it should be noted that DCAT makes extensive use of terms from other vocabularies, in particular Dublin Core [[DCTERMS]].
	DCAT itself defines a minimal set of classes and properties of its own.
  A full set of namespaces and prefixes used in this document is shown in the table below.</p>

<section id="conformance">

<p class="note">Modified from DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]]</p>

<p>A data catalog conforms to DCAT if:</p>
<ul>
	<li> Access to data is organized into datasets, distributions, and data-services. </li>
	<li> An RDF description of the catalog itself and its datasets, distributions, and data-services is available (but the choice of
RDF syntaxes, access protocols, and access policies is not mandated by this specification).</li>
	<li> The contents of all metadata fields that are held in the catalog, and that contain data about the catalog itself and its datasets, distributions, and data-services, are included in this RDF description, expressed using the appropriate classes and properties from DCAT, except where no such class or property exists.</li>
	<li> All classes and properties defined in DCAT are used in a way consistent with the semantics declared in this specification.</li>
	<li>DCAT-compliant catalogs <em title="MAY" class="rfc2119">MAY</em> include additional non-DCAT metadata fields and additional RDF data in the catalog's RDF description.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	A <strong>DCAT profile</strong> is a specification for data catalogs that adds additional constraints to DCAT. A data catalog that conforms to the profile also conforms to DCAT. Additional constraints in a profile <em title="MAY" class="rfc2119">MAY</em> include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li> Cardinality constraints, including a minimum set of required metadata fields </li>
	<li> Sub-classes and sub-properties of the standard DCAT classes and properties</li>
	<li> Classes and properties for additional metadata fields not covered in DCAT</li>

<h2>Vocabulary Overview</h2>

<p class="note">From DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] except as noted</p>

<p>DCAT is an RDF vocabulary well-suited to representing data catalogs such as <a href="https://www.data.gov/">data.gov</a> and <a href="http://data.gov.uk">data.gov.uk</a>. DCAT defines eight main classes:</p>
<ul>
	<li> <code><a href="#Class:_Catalog">dcat:Catalog</a></code> represents the catalog</li>
	<li> <code><a href="#Class:_Resource">dcat:Resource</a></code> represents an item in a catalog.</li>
	<li> <code><a href="#Class:_Dataset">dcat:Dataset</a></code> represents a dataset in a catalog.</li>
	<li> <code><a href="#Class:_Distribution">dcat:Distribution</a></code> represents an accessible form or representation of a dataset as for example a downloadable file.</li>
	<li> <code><a href="#Class:_Service">dcat:DataService</a></code> represents a data service in a catalog.</li>
	<li> <code><a href="#Class:_DataDistributionService">dcat:DataDistributionService</a></code> represents a service that provides access to distributions of datasets and extracts of datasets.</li>
<!--	<li> (<code><a href="#Class:_DataTransformationService">dcat:DataTransformationService</a></code> represents a service that can transform a dataset, e.g. spatial coordinate transformation; interpolation or resampling of a dataset).</li> -->
	<li> <code><a href="#Class:_DiscoveryService">dcat:DiscoveryService</a></code> represents a service that supports discovery functions.</li>
	<li> <code><a href="#Class:_CatalogRecord">dcat:CatalogRecord</a></code> describes a dataset entry in the catalog, primarily concerning the registration information such as who added the item and when</li>
</ul>
<p>
A <b>dataset</b> in DCAT is defined as a "collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more formats".
A dataset is a conceptual entity, and may be represented by one or more <b>distributions</b> that serialize the dataset for transfer.
Distributions of a dataset can be provided via <b>data distribution services</b>.
Detailed properties for a data distribution service API are out of the scope of this version of DCAT. </p>

<p>Datasets and <b>data services</b>, and potentially other types of thing, may be included in a <b>catalog</b>.
Types of data service that might be found in a catalog include data distribution services, <b>discovery services</b> such as portals and catalog services, <b>data transformation services</b> such as coordinate transformation services, re-sampling and interpolation services, and various <b>data processing services</b>.
</p>

<div class="note">
	<p>
	The scope of DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] was limited to catalogs of datasets.
	A number of use cases for the revision involve also having <b>data distribution services</b> as members of a catalog - see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#ID6">DCAT Distribution to describe web services - ID6</a> and
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#ID18">Modeling service-based data access - ID18</a>.
It has been decided to add an explicit class for Data Distribution Services in this revision of DCAT, and to enable these to be part of a Catalog.
Provision for other data services to also be part of a Catalog will also be made, as well as for Catalogs to be composed of other Catalogs.
See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">Issue #172</a>. </p>
<p>
	 <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/milestone/5">Milestone 5</a> collects a number of issues related to this requirement.
</p>
</div>

<p>A <b>CatalogRecord</b> describes an entry in the catalog. Notice that while <code>dcat:Resource</code> represents the dataset or service itself, <code>dcat:CatalogRecord</code> is the record that describes the registration of an item in the catalog. The use of <code>dcat:CatalogRecord</code> is considered optional. It is used to capture provenance information about entries in a catalog. If this distinction is not necessary then <code>dcat:CatalogRecord</code> can be safely ignored.</p>


<p class="note">
    In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] <a href="#class-dataset">dcat:Dataset</a> was a sub-class of <a href="http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Dataset">dctype:Dataset</a>, which is a term of the <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#section-7">DCMI Types vocabulary</a> [[DCTERMS]].
	This relationship has been removed in the revised DCAT vocabulary - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/98">Issue #98</a>.

<section id="basic-example">
<h3>Basic Example</h3>
<p>This example provides a quick overview of how DCAT might be used to represent a government catalog and its datasets. </p>

<p>First, the catalog description:
</p>
<pre>  &nbsp;:catalog
       a dcat:Catalog&nbsp;;
       dct:title "Imaginary Catalog"&nbsp;;
       rdfs:label "Imaginary Catalog"&nbsp;;
       foaf:homepage &lt;http://example.org/catalog&gt;&nbsp;;
       dct:publisher&nbsp;:transparency-office&nbsp;;
       dct:language &lt;http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-1/en&gt; &nbsp;;
       dcat:dataset&nbsp;:dataset-001&nbsp; , :dataset-002 , :dataset-003 ;
       .
</pre>
<p>The publisher of the catalog has the relative URI&nbsp;:transparency-office. Further description of the publisher can be provided as in the following example:
</p>
<pre>  &nbsp;:transparency-office
       a foaf:Organization&nbsp;;
       rdfs:label "Transparency Office"&nbsp;;
       .
</pre>
<p>The catalog lists each of its datasets via the dcat:dataset property. In the example above, an example dataset was mentioned with the relative URI&nbsp;:dataset-001. A possible description of it using DCAT is shown below:
</p>
<pre>  &nbsp;:dataset-001
       a dcat:Dataset&nbsp;;
       dct:title "Imaginary dataset"&nbsp;;
       dcat:keyword "accountability","transparency" ,"payments"&nbsp;;
       dct:issued "2011-12-05"^^xsd:date&nbsp;;
       dct:modified "2011-12-05"^^xsd:date&nbsp;;
       dcat:contactPoint &lt;http://example.org/transparency-office/contact&gt; ;
       dct:temporal &lt;http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/quarter/2006-Q1&gt; ;
       dct:spatial &lt;http://www.geonames.org/6695072&gt; ;
       dct:publisher&nbsp;:finance-ministry&nbsp;;
       dct:language &lt;http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-1/en&gt; &nbsp;;
       dct:accrualPeriodicity &lt;http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx/2009/code#freq-W&gt; &nbsp;;
       dcat:distribution&nbsp;:dataset-001-csv&nbsp;;
       .
</pre>

<p>In order to express the frequency of update in the example above, we chose to use an instance from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/#dsd-cog">Content-Oriented Guidelines</a> developed as part
of the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Data Cube Vocabulary [[VOCAB-DATA-CUBE]] efforts. Additionally, we chose to describe the spatial and temporal coverage of the example dataset using URIs from <a href="http://www.geonames.org/">Geonames</a> and the Interval dataset (originally available from http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/interval) from data.gov.uk, respectively. A contact point is also provided where comments and feedback about the dataset can be sent. Further details about the contact point, such as email address or telephone number, can be provided using vCard [[VCARD-RDF]].</p>

<p>The dataset distribution :dataset-001-csv can be downloaded as a 5Kb CSV file. This information is
represented via an RDF resource of type dcat:Distribution.
</p>
<pre>  &nbsp;:dataset-001-csv
       a dcat:Distribution&nbsp;;
       dcat:downloadURL &lt;http://www.example.org/files/001.csv&gt;&nbsp;;
       dct:title "CSV distribution of imaginary dataset 001"&nbsp;;
       dcat:mediaType "text/csv" ;
       dcat:byteSize "5120"^^xsd:decimal ;
       .
</pre>
</section>

<section id="classifying-datasets">
<h3>Classifying datasets thematically</h3>
<p>The catalog classifies its datasets according to a set of domains represented by the relative URI&nbsp;:themes. SKOS can be used to describe the domains used:
</p>
<pre>  &nbsp;:catalog&nbsp;dcat:themeTaxonomy&nbsp;:themes&nbsp;.
</pre>

<pre>  &nbsp;:themes
       a skos:ConceptScheme&nbsp;;
       skos:prefLabel "A set of domains to classify documents"&nbsp;;
       .
</pre>

<pre>  &nbsp;:dataset-001 dcat:theme&nbsp;:accountability&nbsp; .
</pre>
<p>Notice that this dataset is classified under the domain represented by the relative URI&nbsp;:accountability.
It is recommended to define the concept as part of the concepts scheme identified by the URI&nbsp;:themes that was used to describe the catalog domains. An example SKOS description:
</p>
<pre>  &nbsp;:accountability
       a skos:Concept&nbsp;;
       skos:inScheme&nbsp;:themes&nbsp;;
       skos:prefLabel "Accountability"&nbsp;;
       .
</pre>
</section>

<section id="classifying-dataset-types">
<h3>Classifying dataset types</h3>

<p class="issue" data-number="64">
	The scope of DCAT Datasets is a lot more than tabular data, so a type/genre indication is required.
	A number of controlled vocabularies are available for classification of datasets according to type.
	In some cases, each individual classifier is denoted by a URI so it can be linked directly.
	However, in other cases there is only a text list, or a vocabulary is embedded in a document or code, so the way to indicate an individual item is less direct.
	Guidance about how to use items from various styles of controlled vocabulary are needed alongside the simple case.
</p>

<p>
	The type or genre of a dataset may be indicated using the <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/type">dct:type</a> property:
</p>

<pre>  :dataset-001 dct:type	dctype:Text . </pre>

</section>

<section id="describing-catalog-records-metadata">
<h3>Describing catalog records metadata</h3>
<p>If the catalog publisher decides to keep metadata
describing its records (i.e. the records containing metadata
describing the datasets), dcat:CatalogRecord can be used. For example,
while &nbsp;:dataset-001 was issued on 2011-12-05, its description on Imaginary Catalog was added on 2011-12-11. This can be represented by DCAT as in the following:
</p>
<pre>  &nbsp;:catalog  dcat:record&nbsp;:record-001&nbsp; .
</pre>

<pre>  &nbsp;:record-001
       a dcat:CatalogRecord&nbsp;;
       foaf:primaryTopic&nbsp;:dataset-001&nbsp;;
       dct:issued "2011-12-11"^^xsd:date&nbsp;;
       .
</pre>
</section>

<section id="a-dataset-available-only-behind-some-web-page">
<h3>Dataset available only behind some Web page</h3>
<p>:dataset-002 is available as a CSV file. However :dataset-002 can only be obtained through some Web page
where the user needs to follow some links, provide some information and check some boxes
before accessing the data</p>

<pre>  &nbsp;:dataset-002
       a dcat:Dataset ;
       dcat:landingPage &lt;http://example.org/dataset-002.html&gt; ;
       dcat:distribution :dataset-002-csv ;
       .
  &nbsp;:dataset-002-csv
       a dcat:Distribution ;
       dcat:accessURL &lt;http://example.org/dataset-002.html&gt; ;
       dcat:mediaType "text/csv" ;
       .
</pre>

Notice the use of a dcat:landingPage and the definition of the dcat:Distribution instance.
</section>

<section id="a-dataset-available-as-download-and-behind-some-web-page">
<h3>A dataset available as a download and behind some Web page</h3>
<p>On the other hand, :dataset-003 can be obtained through some landing page but also can be downloaded from a known URL.
</p>
<pre>  &nbsp;:dataset-003
       a dcat:Dataset ;
       dcat:landingPage &lt;http://example.org/dataset-003.html&gt; ;
       dcat:distribution :dataset-003-csv ;
       .
  &nbsp;:dataset-003-csv
       a dcat:Distribution ;
       dcat:downloadURL &lt;http://example.org/dataset-003.csv&gt; .
       dcat:mediaType "text/csv" ;
       .
</pre>
Notice that we used dcat:downloadURL with the downloadable distribution and that the other distribution accessible through the landing page
does not have to be defined as a separate dcat:Distribution instance.

then it is appropriate to place the description of each dataset
(consisting of all RDF triples that mention the dcat:Dataset, dcat:CatalogRecord, and any of its dcat:Distributions)
into a separate named graph. The name of that graph should be the IRI of the catalog record.

    <h2>Quality information</h2

    <div class="note">
        <p>This section is not-normative as it provides guidance on how to document the quality of DCAT first class entities (e.g., datasets, distributions) and it does not define new DCAT terms. The guidance relies on the Data Quality Vocabulary(DQV)[[vocab-dqv]], which is a W3C Group Note.</p>
    </div>
    
<p class="issue" data-number="58">
	The need to choose or define a data <b>quality model</b> has been identified as a requirement to be satisfied in the revision of DCAT.
</p> 
The Data Quality Vocabulary (DQV) offers common modelling patterns for different aspects of Data Quality.

It can relate  DCAT datasets and distributions with different types of quality information including
<ul>
    <li> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dqv/#dqv:QualityAnnotation"> dqv:QualityAnnotation</a>, which represents feedback and quality certificates given about the dataset or its distribution. </li> 
    <li> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dqv/#dqv:QualityPolicy">dqv:QualityPolicy</a>, which represents a policy or agreement that is chiefly governed by data quality concerns.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dqv/#dqv:QualityMeasurement">dqv:QualityMeasurement</a>, which represents a metric value providing quantitative or qualitative information about the dataset or distribution.</li>
</ul>

Each type of quality information can pertain to one or more quality dimensions, namely, quality characteristics relevant to the consumer. The practice to see the quality as a multi-dimensional space is consolidated in the field of quality management to split the quality management into addressable chunks. DQV does not define a normative list of quality dimensions. It offers the quality dimensions proposed in ISO/IEC 25012 [[ISOIEC25012]] and Zaveri et al. [[ZaveriEtAl]] as two possible starting points. It also provides an <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ldqd">RDF representation</a> for the quality dimensions and categories defined in the latter. Ultimately, implementers will need to choose themselves the collection of quality dimensions that best fits their needs.  

The following section shows how DCAT and DQV can be coupled to describe the quality of datasets and distributions. 
For a comprehensive introduction  and further examples of use, please refer to the Data Quality Vocabulary (DQV) group note [[vocab-dqv]].    
<div class="note">
<p>The following examples make no comments on where the quality information would reside and how it is managed. That is out of scope for the DCAT vocabulary.  The assumption made is that the quality individuals are available using the URIs indicated.
Besides, the examples and more in general the DQV  is neutral to the data portal design choices on how to collect quality information. For example, data portals can collect DQV instances by implementing specific UI to annotate data or by taking inputs from 3rd-party services.

	<h2>Relation to other W3C Recommendations</h2>

	<p class="issue" data-number="254">
		DCAT should be aligned with other recent Linked Data based Recommendations.
	</p>
	
	<section id="ldp">
		<h3>Linked Data Platform (LDP)</h3>
		
		<p>
			DCAT provides a data model for representation of metadata about datasets in the form of Linked Data, but it does not specify how this metadata should be accessed or modified.
			The DCAT compatible metadata can be viewed as collections of Catalog Records, Datasets and Data Services contained in a Catalog, and a collection of Distributions contained in a Dataset.
			The Linked Data Platform [[ldp]] specification deals with access to and modification of Linked Data Platform Containers (LDPCs).
			This section provides guidance on how to represent DCAT metadata as LDP Containers, which supports namely the implementation of <a href="https://solid.mit.edu/" title="Solid">Solid</a> based DCAT catalogs.
		</p>

		<p>
			First, we will present an example of a LDPC for datasets in a catalog.
			There is one catalog with one dataset.
			The dataset is contained in the <code>&lt;/datasets/&gt;</code> LDP Direct Container.
			To ensure the LDPC discovery, we connect it to the Catalog using the <code>dcat:datasets</code> predicate.
		</p>
		<div class="example">
			<div class="example-title marker">
				<span>Example 1</span>
			</div>
			<pre class="nohighlight turtle" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
@prefix dcat: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#&gt; .
@prefix ldp:  &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#&gt; .

@base &lt;https://example.org/resource/catalog&gt; .

&lt;&gt; a dcat:Catalog ;
	dcat:datasets &lt;/datasets/&gt; ;
	dcat:dataset &lt;/datasets/001&gt; .
	
&lt;/datasets/&gt; a ldp:Container, ldp:DirectContainer ;
	ldp:membershipResource &lt;&gt; ;
	ldp:hasMemberRelation dcat:dataset ;
	ldp:contains &lt;/datasets/001&gt; .
	
&lt;/datasets/001&gt; a dcat:Dataset .</pre>
		</div>
		
		<p>
			In the second example, we add LDPCs <code>&lt;/records/&gt;</code> for Catalog Records and <code>&lt;/services/&gt;</code> for Data Services, discoverable using <code>dcat:records</code> and <code>dcat:services</code> predicates from the Catalog:
		</p>
		<div class="example">
			<div class="example-title marker">
				<span>Example 2</span>
			</div>
			<pre class="nohighlight turtle" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
@prefix dcat: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#&gt; .
@prefix ldp:  &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#&gt; .

@base &lt;https://example.org/resource/catalog&gt; .

&lt;&gt; a dcat:Catalog ;
	dcat:records &lt;/records/&gt; ;
	dcat:datasets &lt;/datasets/&gt; ;
	dcat:services &lt;/services/&gt; ;
	dcat:dataset &lt;/datasets/001&gt; .
	
&lt;/records/&gt; a ldp:Container, ldp:DirectContainer ;
	ldp:membershipResource &lt;&gt; ;
	ldp:hasMemberRelation dcat:record ;
	ldp:contains &lt;/records/001&gt; .

&lt;/datasets/&gt; a ldp:Container, ldp:DirectContainer ;
	ldp:membershipResource &lt;&gt; ;
	ldp:hasMemberRelation dcat:dataset ;
	ldp:contains &lt;/datasets/001&gt; .
	
&lt;/services/&gt; a ldp:Container, ldp:DirectContainer ;
	ldp:membershipResource &lt;&gt; ;
	ldp:hasMemberRelation dcat:service ;
	ldp:contains &lt;/services/001&gt; .

&lt;/records/001&gt; a dcat:CatalogRecord ;
	foaf:primaryTopic &lt;/datasets/001&gt; .
	
&lt;/datasets/001&gt; a dcat:Dataset ;

&lt;/services/001&gt; a dcat:DataService .</pre>
		</div>
		<p>
			Each dataset has its own LDPC for its distributions.
			In the third example, we show the LDPC <code>&lt;/datasets/001/distributions/&gt;</code> for distributions of a single dataset, <code>&lt;/datasets/001&gt;</code>, discoverable through the <code>dcat:distributions</code> predicate.
		</p>
		<div class="example">
			<div class="example-title marker">
				<span>Example 3</span>
			</div>
			<pre class="nohighlight turtle" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">

@prefix ldp:  &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#&gt; .

&lt;/datasets/001&gt; a dcat:Dataset ;
	dcat:distributions &lt;/datasets/001/distributions/&gt; ;
	dcat:distribution &lt;/datasets/001/distributions/001&gt; .

&lt;/datasets/001/distributions/&gt; a ldp:Container, ldp:DirectContainer ;

&lt;/datasets/001/distributions/001&gt; a dcat:Distribution .</pre>
		</div>
		
		<p class="note">For catalogs with many datasets, catalog records, data services or distributions, 
		the Linked Data Platform Paging mechanism [[ldp-paging]] SHOULD be used to provide access to them.</p>
		
		<p>
			In the next sections we formally define the additional properties used for discovery of LDP containers.

        <h3>Changes since the W3C Recommendation of 16 January 2014</h3>
        <p>The document has undergone the following changes since the W3C Recommendation of 16 January 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]]:</p>

        <ul>
<li>
	<a href="#class-resource">Class: Catalogued resource</a>: In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the scope of a <a href="#class-catalog">dcat:Catalog</a> was limited to Datasets. This has been generalized, and properties common to all catalogued resources are now associated with a super-class dcat:Resource - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">Issue #172</a>.
</li>

<li>
	<a href="#class-dataservice">Class: Data service</a>: In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the scope of a <a href="#class-catalog">dcat:Catalog</a> was limited to Datasets. The new class dcat:DataService has been added to support cataloguing various kinds of data services - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">Issue #172</a>.
</li>

<li>
	<a href="#class-datadistributionservice">Class: Data distribution service</a>: In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the scope of a <a href="#class-catalog">dcat:Catalog</a> was limited to Datasets. The new class dcat:DataDistributionService has been added to support cataloguing data distribution services - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">Issue #172</a>.
</li>

<li>
	<a href="#class-discoveryservice">Class: Discovery service</a>: In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the scope of a <a href="#class-catalog">dcat:Catalog</a> was limited to Datasets. The new class dcat:DiscoveryService has been added to support cataloguing data discovery services - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">Issue #172</a>.
</li>

<li><a href="#class-dataset">Class: Dataset</a>:
In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] <a href="#class-dataset">dcat:Dataset</a> was a sub-class of <a href="http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Dataset">dctype:Dataset</a>, which is a term of the <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#section-7">DCMI Types vocabulary</a> [[DCTERMS]]. This relationship has been removed in the revised DCAT vocabulary - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/98">Issue #98</a>.
</li>

<li><a href="#Property:dataset_theme">Property: theme/category</a>:
	In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the domain of dcat:theme was dcat:Dataset,
  which limited use of this property in other contexts. The domain has been relaxed in this revision -
  see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/123">Issue #123</a>.
</li>

<li><a href="#Property:dataset_type">Property: type/genre</a>:
	Added in DCAT revision - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/64">Issue #64</a>.
</li>

<li><a href="#Property:dataset_keyword">Property: keyword/tag</a>:
	In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the domain of dcat:keyword was dcat:Dataset,
  which limited use of this property in other contexts. The domain has been relaxed in this revision -
  see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/121">Issue #121</a>.
</li>

<li><a href="#Property:dataset_contactPoint">Property: contact point</a>:
	In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the domain of dcat:contactPoint was dcat:Dataset,
  which limited use of this property in other contexts. The domain has been relaxed in this revision -
  see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/95">Issue #95</a>.
</li>

<li><a href="#Property:dataset_landingpage">Property: landing page</a>:
	In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the domain of dcat:landingPage was dcat:Dataset,
  which limited use of this property in other contexts. The domain has been relaxed in this revision -
  see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/122">Issue #122</a>.
</li>

<li><a href="#Property:vann:usageNote">Property: vann:usageNote</a>:
    DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] included documentation captured as text using <a href="http://vocab.org/vann/#usageNote">vann:usageNote</a> elements,
    which is a sub-property of rdfs:seeAlso - an owl:ObjectProperty that cannot have a Literal value.
    This revision of DCAT has fixed these issues and replaced the use of vann:usageNote with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/#secdocumentation">skos:scopeNote</a> -
    see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/233">Issue #233</a>.
