    <p>This document presents advancements in the discussion made on DCAT 3 within DXWG group. It extends DCAT 2 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-2]] with terms and guidelines on versioning and dataset series (see sections <a href="#dataset-versions"></a> and <a href="#dataset-series"></a>), and by including terms for specifying the checksum of a distribution (see <a href="#Property:distribution_checksum"></a> and <a href="#Class:Checksum"></a>).</p>
    </aside>
	
<aside class="note">
    <p>DCAT 2 supersedes DCAT [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] (hereafter named DCAT 1), but it does not make it obsolete. DCAT 2 maintains the DCAT namespace as its terms preserve backward compatibility with DCAT [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]]. DCAT 2 relaxes constraints and adds new classes and properties, but these changes do not break the definition of previous terms.</p>
    
    <p>Any new implementation is expected to adopt DCAT 2, while the existing implementations do not need to upgrade to it, unless they want to use the new features. In particular, current DCAT 1 deployments that do not overlap with the DCAT 2 new features (e.g., data services, time and space properties qualified relations, packaging) don't need to change anything to remain in conformance with DCAT 2.

    <p>DCAT is an RDF vocabulary designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogs published on the Web.

    <p>DCAT enables a publisher to describe datasets and data services in a catalog using a standard model and vocabulary that facilitates the consumption and aggregation of metadata from multiple catalogs.
        This can increase the discoverability of datasets and data services.
        It also makes it possible to have a decentralized approach to publishing data catalogs and makes federated search for datasets across catalogs in multiple sites possible using the same query mechanism and structure.
        Aggregated DCAT metadata can serve as a manifest file as part of the digital preservation process.</p>

<p>To be updated</p>
</aside>

    <p>
        This document defines a major revision of the original DCAT vocabulary ([[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]]) in response to new use cases, requirements and community experience since that publication.  This revision extends the original DCAT standard in line with community practice while supporting diverse approaches to data description and dataset exchange. The main changes to the DCAT vocabulary have been: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>loosening of constraints in class and property definitions to promote re-use of terms and modularity</li>
        <li>addition of a <a href="#Class:Resource"><code>dcat:Resource</code></a> class for representing any asset than can be included in the catalog, this is
            now the super-class of <a href="#Class:Dataset"><code>dcat:Dataset</code></a></li>
        <li>addition of <a href="#Class:Data_Service"><code>dcat:DataService</code></a>, as a sub-class of <a href="#Class:Resource"><code>dcat:Resource</code></a>, to support catalog service end-points providing access to data assets</li>
        <li>addition of ways to represent <a href="#examples-bag-of-files">loosely structured catalogs</a>, where there is no distinction between a dataset and its distributions</li>
        <li>more details for the ways of representing <a href="#examples-dataset-provenance">dataset provenance</a> and <a href="#quality-information">quality</a></li>
        <li>an <a href="#dcat-sdo">alignment</a> between the DCAT vocabulary and the schema.org vocabulary</li>
    </ul>


    <p>
        This new version of the vocabulary updates and expands the original but preserves backward compatibility. A full list of the significant changes (with links to the relevent github issues) is described in <a href="#changes"></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The exit criteria for CR focussed on v2 new features that replicate features that were included in application profiles of v1 as a way of remedying missing and necessary elements.  The exit criteria also included recent commitments by organisations such as EC Joinup to <a href='https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/solution/abr-specification-registry-registries/document/specification-registry-registries-version-meeting-september'>adopt the DCAT v2 model</a> in their work.
        Implementation will be evidenced by showing use of the new properties/classes (or terms with equivalent meaning) in implementations of catalogs.

    </p>
    <h3 id="dcat_history">DCAT history</h3>
    <p>The original DCAT vocabulary was developed and hosted at the <a href="http://www.deri.ie">Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI)</a>, then refined by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/egov/">eGov Interest Group</a>, and finally standardized in 2014 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/gld/">Government Linked Data (GLD)</a> Working Group.</p>
    <p>This revised version of DCAT was developed by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/">Dataset Exchange Working Group</a> in response to a new set of Use Cases and Requirements [[?DCAT-UCR]] gathered from peoples' experience with the DCAT vocabulary from the time of the original version, and new applications that were not considered in the first version. A summary of the changes from [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] is provided in <a href="#changes"></a>. </p>

    <h3 id="external_terms">External terms</h3>
    <p>DCAT incorporates terms from pre-existing vocabularies where stable terms with appropriate meanings could be found, such as <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage"><code>foaf:homepage</code></a> and <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/title"><code>dcterms:title</code></a>.
      Informal summary definitions of the externally-defined terms are included in the DCAT vocabulary for convenience, while authoritative definitions are available in the normative references.
      Changes to definitions in the references, if any, supersede the summaries given in this specification.
      Note that conformance to DCAT (<a href="#conformance"></a>) concerns usage of only the terms in the DCAT vocabulary specification, so possible changes to other external definitions will not affect the conformance of DCAT implementations.</p>

    <h3 id="please_send_comments">Please send comments</h3>
    The Working Group invited publishers to describe their catalogs and datasets with the revised version of DCAT described in this document and to report their implementations following <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/wiki/DCAT-implementation-evidence">the instruction  to reporting DCAT revised implementations</a>. This information and subsequent analysis is published in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/dcat-implementation-report/">implementation report.</a>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Sharing data resources among different organizations, researchers, governments and citizens requires the provision of metadata.
        This is irrespective of the data being open or not.
        DCAT is a vocabulary for publishing data catalogs on the Web, which was originally developed in the context of government data catalogs
        such as <a href="https://www.data.gov/">data.gov</a> and <a href="https://data.gov.uk">data.gov.uk</a>, but it is also applicable and has been used in other contexts.
    <p>

    <p>
        DCAT 2 has extended the previous version to support further use cases and requirements [[?DCAT-UCR]].
        These include the possibility of cataloging other resources in addition to
        datasets, such as data services. The revision also supports describing relationships between datasets as well as between
        datasets and other cataloged resources.  Guidance on how to document licenses and rights statements associated with the cataloged items is provided.
   </p>

   <p>
    DCAT provides RDF classes and properties to allow datasets and data services to be described and included in a catalog.
    The use of a standard model and vocabulary facilitates the consumption and aggregation of metadata from multiple catalogs, which can:</p>


    <ol>
      <li>
        increase the discoverability of datasets and data services
      </li>
      <li>
        allow federated search for datasets across catalogs in multiple sites
      </li>
    </ol>


    <p>
        Data described in a catalog can come in many formats, ranging from spreadsheets, through XML and RDF to various specialized formats.
        DCAT does not make any assumptions about these serialization formats of the datasets but it does
        distinguish between the abstract dataset and its different manifestations or distributions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Data is often provided through a service which supports selection of an extract, sub-set, or combination of existing data, or of new data generated by some data processing function.
        DCAT allows the description of a data access service to be included in a catalog.
    </p>

    <p>
      Complementary vocabularies can be used together with DCAT to provide more detailed format-specific information.
      For example, properties from the VoID vocabulary [[?VOID]] can be used within DCAT to express various statistics about a dataset if that dataset is in RDF format.
    </p>

    <p>
      This document does not prescribe any particular method of deploying data catalogs expressed in DCAT.
      DCAT information can be presented in many forms including RDF accessible via SPARQL endpoints, embedded in HTML pages as [[?HTML-RDFa]], or serialized as RDF/XML [[?RDF-SYNTAX-GRAMMAR]], [[?N3]], [[?Turtle]], [[?JSON-LD]] or other formats.
      Within this document the examples use [[?Turtle]] because of its readability.

<h2>Motivation for change</h2>

<aside class="ednote">
<p>To be updated</p>
</aside>

    <p>The original Recommendation [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] published in January 2014 provided the basic framework for describing datasets. It made an important distinction between a <i>dataset</i> as an abstract idea and a <i>distribution</i> as a manifestation of the dataset. Although DCAT has been widely adopted, it has become clear that the original specification lacked a number of essential features that were added either through the mechanism of a profile, such as the European Commission's DCAT-AP [[?DCAT-AP]], or the development of larger vocabularies that to a greater or lesser extent built upon the base standard, such as the Healthcare and Life Sciences Community Profile [[?HCLS-Dataset]], the Data Tag Suite [[?DATS]] and more. DCAT 2 has been developed to address the specific shortcomings that have come to light through the experiences of different communities, the aim being to improve interoperability between the outputs of these larger vocabularies.
    For example, in DCAT 2 we provide classes, properties and guidance to address <a href="#dereferenceable-identifiers">identifiers</a>, <a href="#quality-information">dataset quality information</a>, and <a href="#data-citation">data citation</a> issues.</p>
    <p>This revision includes re-writing of the specification throughout. Significant changes from the 2014 Recommendation are marked within the text using "Note" sections, as well as being described in <a href="#changes"></a>.</p>

<section id="namespaces">

    <h2 >Namespaces</h2>

    <p>The namespace for DCAT is <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#</code>.
        DCAT also makes extensive use of terms from other vocabularies, in particular Dublin Core [[?DCTERMS]].
        DCAT defines a minimal set of classes and properties of its own.</p>

    <h2>Vocabulary overview</h2>

    <section id="dcat-scope">
    <h3>DCAT scope</h3>

    <p>DCAT is an RDF vocabulary for representing data catalogs.
      DCAT is based around seven main classes (<a href="#fig-dcat-all-attributes"></a>):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="#Class:Catalog"><code>dcat:Catalog</code></a> represents a catalog, which is a dataset in which each individual item is a metadata record describing some resource; the scope of <code>dcat:Catalog</code> is collections of metadata about <b>datasets</b> or <b>data services</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#Class:Resource"><code>dcat:Resource</code></a> represents a dataset, a data service or any other resource that may be described by a metadata record in a catalog.
          This class is not intended to be used directly, but is the parent class of <a href="#Class:Dataset"><code>dcat:Dataset</code></a>, <a href="#Class:Data_Service"><code>dcat:DataService</code></a> and <a href="#Class:Catalog"><code>dcat:Catalog</code></a>.
          Member items in a catalog should be members of one of the sub-classes, or of a sub-class of these, or of a sub-class of <a href="#Class:Resource"><code>dcat:Resource</code></a> defined in a DCAT profile or other DCAT application.
          <a href="#Class:Resource"><code>dcat:Resource</code></a> is effectively an extension point for defining a catalog of any kind of resource. <a href="#Class:Dataset"><code>dcat:Dataset</code></a> and <a href="#Class:Data_Service"><code>dcat:DataService</code></a> can be used for datasets and services which are not documented in any catalog.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#Class:Dataset"><code>dcat:Dataset</code></a> represents a dataset.
          A dataset is a collection of data, published or curated by a single agent or identifiable community. The notion of dataset in DCAT is broad and inclusive, with the intention of accommodating resource types arising from all communities. Data comes in many forms including numbers, text, pixels, imagery, sound and other multi-media, and potentially other types, any of which might be collected into a dataset.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#Class:Distribution"><code>dcat:Distribution</code></a> represents an accessible form of a dataset such as a downloadable file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#Class:Data_Service"><code>dcat:DataService</code></a> represents a data service.
          A data service is a collection of operations accessible through an interface (<abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>) that provide access to one or more datasets or data processing functions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#Class:Dataset_Series"><code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code></a> is a dataset, which represents a collection of datasets that are published separately, but share some common characteristics that groups them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#Class:Catalog_Record"><code>dcat:CatalogRecord</code></a> represents a metadata item in the catalog, primarily concerning the registration information, such as who added the item and when.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="ednote" title="Class Diagram need to be updated">
              <p>
                 Changes required for the class diagram are tracked in issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/1320">#1320</a>.

    <aside class="note">
      <p>
        Along with the rest of <a href="#vocabulary-overview"></a>, this diagram is <b>non-normative</b>.
        Furthermore, while the diagram uses UML-style class notation it should be interpreted following the usual RDF open-world assumptions around the presence/absence of properties, relationships, and their cardinality.
        The properties shown in each class reflect those specified in the descriptions of classes in <a href="#vocabulary-specification"></a>.
        Open arrow-heads indicate RDFS <i>sub-class-of</i> relationships (not object-oriented generalization). 
        To assist in understanding the full scope of each class, available properties are copied down from each '::super-class'.
        Cardinalities are shown in a few places to reinforce expectations, but these are not axiomatized or enforced in any way by this (normative) recommendation.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <p>
        A <b>dataset</b> in DCAT is defined as a "collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more serializations or formats".
        A dataset is a conceptual entity, and can be represented by one or more <b>distributions</b> that serialize the dataset for transfer.
        Distributions of a dataset can be provided via <b>data services</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A data service typically provides selection, extraction, combination, processing or transformation operations over datasets that might be hosted locally or remote to the service.
      The result of any request to a data service is a representation of a part or all of a dataset or catalog.
      A data service might be tied to specific datasets, or its source data might be configured at request- or run-time.
      A data distribution service allows selection and download of a distribution of a dataset or subset.
      A data discovery service allows a client to find a suitable dataset.
      Other kinds of data service include data transformation services, such as coordinate transformation services, re-sampling and interpolation services, and various data processing services, including simulation and modelling services.
      Note that a data service in DCAT is a collection of operations or <b>API</b> which provides access to data.
      An interactive user-interface is often available to provide convenient access to API operations, but its description is outside the scope of DCAT.
      The details of a particular data service endpoint will often be specified through a description conforming to a standard service type, which complement the scope of the DCAT vocabulary itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Descriptions of datasets and data services can be included in a <b>catalog</b>.
      A catalog is a kind of dataset whose member items are descriptions of datasets and data services.
      Other types of things might also be cataloged, but the scope of DCAT is currently limited to datasets and data services.
      To extend the scope of a catalog beyond datasets and data services it is recommended to define additional sub-classes of <a href="#Class:Resource"><code>dcat:Resource</code></a> in a DCAT profile or other DCAT application.
      To extend the scope of service descriptions beyond data distribution services it is recommended to define additional sub-classes of <a href="#Class:Data_Service"><code>dcat:DataService</code></a> in a DCAT profile or other DCAT application.
    </p>

    <aside class="note">
      <p>
        The scope of DCAT 1 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] was limited to catalogs of datasets.
        A number of use cases for the revision [[?DCAT-UCR]] involve <b>data services</b> as members of a catalog - see <a data-cite="DCAT-UCR#ID6">&sect;&nbsp;<span class="secno">5.16 </span>DCAT Distribution to describe Web services</a> and
        <a data-cite="DCAT-UCR#ID18">&sect;&nbsp;<span class="secno">5.18 </span>Modeling service-based data access</a>.
        Hence, the scope of DCAT 2 includes both datasets and data services to enable these to be part of a DCAT conformant catalog.
        Provision for catalogs to be composed of other catalogs is also made.
        See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">#172</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Catalogs of other kinds of things might be designed following the DCAT pattern, e.g. dealing with facilities, instruments, samples and specimens, other physical artefacts, events or activities.
        These are currently out of scope for DCAT, but might be defined through further sub-classes of <a href="#Class:Resource"><code>dcat:Resource</code></a>, which could be specified in a DCAT profile or other DCAT application.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <p>A <b>catalog record</b> describes an entry in the catalog. Notice that while <a href="#Class:Resource"><code>dcat:Resource</code></a> represents the dataset or service itself, <a href="#Class:Catalog_Record"><code>dcat:CatalogRecord</code></a> is the record that describes the registration of an item in the catalog. The use of <a href="#Class:Catalog_Record"><code>dcat:CatalogRecord</code></a> is considered optional. It is used to capture provenance information about entries in a catalog explicitly. If this is not necessary then <a href="#Class:Catalog_Record"><code>dcat:CatalogRecord</code></a> can be safely ignored.</p>

    <h3>RDF considerations</h3>
      <p id="owl2">
        The DCAT vocabulary is an OWL2 ontology [[?OWL2-OVERVIEW]] formalized using [[?RDF-SCHEMA]].
        Each class and property in DCAT is denoted by an <abbr title="Internationalized Resource Identifier">IRI</abbr> [[?RFC3987]].
        Locally defined elements are in the namespace <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#"><code>http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#</code></a>.
        Elements are also adopted from several external vocabularies, in particular [[?FOAF]], [[?DCTERMS]] and [[?PROV-O]]
      </p>
      <p id="blankNodes">
        RDF allows resources to have global identifiers (<abbr title="Internationalized Resource Identifiers">IRIs</abbr>) or to be blank nodes.
        Blank nodes can be used to denote resources without explicitly naming them with an IRI.
        They can appear in the subject and object position of a triple [[?RDF11-PRIMER]].
        For example, in many actual DCAT catalogs, distributions are represented as blank nodes nested inside the related dataset description.
        While blank nodes can offer flexibility for some use cases, in a Linked Data context, blank nodes limit our ability to collaboratively annotate data.
        A  blank node resource cannot be the target of a link and it can't be annotated with new information from new sources.
        As one of the biggest benefits of the Linked Data approach is that "anyone can say anything anywhere", use of blank nodes undermines some of the advantages we can gain from wide adoption of the RDF model.
        Even within the closed world of a single application dataset, use of blank nodes can quickly become limiting when integrating new data [[?LinkedDataPatterns]].
        For these reasons, it is recommended that instances of the DCAT main classes have a global identifier, and use of blank nodes is generally discouraged when encoding DCAT in RDF.

          Elements from a number of complementary vocabularies MAY be used together with DCAT to provide more detailed information.
        For example: properties from the VoID vocabulary [[?VOID]] allow the description of various statistics about a DCAT-described dataset if that dataset is in RDF format; properties from the Provenance ontology [[!PROV-O]] can be used to provide more information about the workflow that generated a dataset or service and related activities and agents; classes and properties from the Organization Ontology [[?VOCAB-ORG]] can be used to explain additional details of responsible agents.

        <p>
            The definitions (including domain and range) of terms outside the DCAT namespace are provided here only for convenience and MUST NOT be considered normative. The authoritative definitions of these terms are in the corresponding specifications, i.e. [[!DC11]], [[!DCTERMS]], [[!FOAF]], [[!PROV-O]], [[!RDF-SCHEMA]], [[!SKOS-REFERENCE]], [[!XMLSCHEMA11-2]] and [[?VCARD-RDF]].

        <aside class="note">
          <p>The scope of DCAT 1 was catalogs of datasets [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]]. This has been generalized, and properties common to all cataloged resources are now associated with a super-class <a href="#Class:Resource"><code>dcat:Resource</code></a>.</p>
          <p>Moreover, an explicit class for <a href="#Class:Data_Service">data services</a> has been added in DCAT 2, to enable these to be part of a catalog.</p>
          <p>Finally, <code>dcat:Catalog</code> has been made a sub-class of <code>dcat:Dataset</code>, and provision for catalogs to be composed of other catalogs is also enabled.</p>

            <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/Standard"><code>dcterms:Standard</code></a> is defined in [[?DCTERMS]] as "A basis for comparison; a reference point against which other things can be evaluated."

                Many existing and legacy catalogs do not distinguish between dataset components, representations, documentation, schemata and other resources that are lumped together as part of a dataset.
                <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#http://purl.org/dc/terms/relation"><code title="http://purl.org/dc/terms/relation">dcterms:relation</code></a> is a super-property of a number of more specific properties which express more precise relationships, so use of <code>dcterms:relation</code> is not inconsistent with a subsequent reclassification with more specific semantics, though the more specialized sub-properties SHOULD be used to link a dataset to component and supplementary resources if possible.

            <p> Examples of distributions include a CSV file, a [[?netCDF]] file, a JSON document, or a data-cube, files made accessible according to different profiles, such as XML or JSON schemas or [[?ShEx]] or [[?SHACL]] expressions.</p>

            <p>In some cases all distributions of a dataset will be fully informationally equivalent, in the sense that lossless transformations between the representations are possible.
            An example would be different serializations of an RDF graph using RDF/XML [[?RDF-SYNTAX-GRAMMAR]], [[?Turtle]], [[?N3]], [[?JSON-LD]].
            However, in other cases the distributions might have different levels of fidelity to the underlying data.
            For example, a graphical representation about the data on a CSV file may not contain the same total information recorded in the CSV file, but they could be considered as two distributions for the same dataset as they are about the same data.
            </p>
            <p>
            As a counter-example, budget data for different years would usually be modelled as different datasets, each with their own distributions, since all distributions of one dataset should broadly contain the same data.
          </p>
          <p>
          Nevertheless, the question of whether different representations can be understood to be distributions of the same dataset, or distributions of different datasets, is application specific. Judgement about how to describe them is the responsibility of the provider, taking into account their understanding of the expectations of users, and practices in the relevant community. </p>

<section id="dereferenceable-identifiers" class="informative">
    <h2>Dereferenceable identifiers</h2>

    <p>The scientific and data provider communities use a number of different identifiers for publications, authors and data. DCAT primarily relies on persistent HTTP IRIs as an effective way of making identifiers actionable. Notably, quite a few identifier schemes can be encoded as dereferenceable HTTP IRIs, and some of them are also returning machine-readable metadata (e.g., <abbr title="Digital Object Identifier">DOIs</abbr> [[?ISO-26324]] and <a href="https://orcid.org/"><abbr title="Open Researcher and Contributor ID">ORCIDs</abbr></a>). Regardless, data providers still might need to refer to legacy identifiers, non-HTTP dereferenceable identifiers, locally minted or third-party-provided identifiers. In these cases, [[?DCTERMS]] and [[?VOCAB-ADMS]] can be of use.</p>
    <p>The property <a href="#Property:resource_identifier"><code>dcterms:identifier</code></a> explicitly indicates HTTP IRIs as well as legacy identifiers. In the following examples,  <a href="#Property:resource_identifier"><code>dcterms:identifier</code></a> identifies a dataset, but it can similarly be used with any kind of resources.</p>

<aside id="ex-identifier" class="example">
<pre class="nohighlight turtle">
&lt;https://example.org/id&gt; a dcat:Dataset;
  dcterms:identifier "https://example.org/id"^^xsd:anyURI ;
  .</pre>
</aside>

    <p> Proxy dereferenceable IRIs can be used when resources have not HTTP dereferenceable IDs. For example, in <a href="#ex-proxy-id"></a>, <code>https://example.org/proxyid</code> is a proxy for <code>id</code>.</p>

<aside id="ex-proxy-id" class="example">
<pre class="nohighlight turtle">
&lt;https://example.org/proxyid&gt; a dcat:Dataset;
  dcterms:identifier "id"^^xsd:string ;
  .</pre>

    <p><a href="#ex-adms-identifier"></a> does not represent the authority responsible for assigning and maintaining identifiers using that scheme (e.g., <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>) as naming the registrant goes against the philosophy of DOI, where the sub-spaces are abstracted from the organization that registers them, with the advantage that DOIs do not change when the organization changes or the responsibility for that sub-space is handed over to someone else. <a href="#ex-adms-identifier"></a> shows a locally minted identifier for the creator of the dataset (e.g., <code>https://example.org/PoelenJorritHID</code>) and its correspondent ORCID identifier (e.g., <code>https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3138-4118</code>). </p>
    <p>When the HTTP dereferenceable ID returns an RDF/OWL description for the dataset, the use of <code>owl:sameAs</code> might be considered. For example,</p>

</aside>

    <p>The need to distinguish between primary and alternative (or legacy) identifiers for a dataset within DCAT has been posed as a requirement. However, it is very much application-specific and would be better addressed in DCAT profiles rather than mandating a general approach.</p>

    <p>Depending on the application context, specific guidelines such as <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/release/dcat-ap-how-manage-duplicates">"DCAT-AP: How to manage duplicates?"</a> can be adopted for distinguishing authoritative datasets from dataset harvested by third parties catalogs.</p>

    <h2>Indicating common identifier types</h2>

    <p> If identifiers are not HTTP dereferenceable, common identifier types can be served as <a data-cite="?RDF11-CONCEPTS#dfn-recognized-datatype-iris">RDF datatypes</a> [[?RDF11-CONCEPTS]] or custom <a data-cite="?OWL2-SYNTAX#Datatype_Definitions">OWL datatypes</a> [[OWL2-SYNTAX]] for the sake of interoperability, see <code>ex:type</code> in <a href="#ex-identifier-type"></a>.</p>

    <h2>License and rights statements</h2>

<aside class="ednote">
<p>The following NOTE should probably be dropped from DCAT3.</p>
</aside>

  <aside class="note">
    <p>
    DCAT 1 handling of license and rights do not appear to satisfy all requirements [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]].
    The recently completed W3C ODRL model [[?ODRL-MODEL]] and vocabulary [[?ODRL-VOCAB]] provide a rich language for describing many kinds of rights and obligations.
    In this section, we describe some patterns for linking DCAT Datasets and/or Distributions to suitable license and rights expressions.
  </p>
  </aside>

  <p>
    Selecting the right way to express conditions for access to and re-use of resources can be complex.
    Implementers should always seek legal advice before deciding which conditions apply to the resource being described.
  </p>
  <p>
    This specification distinguishes three main situations:
    one where a statement is associated with a resource that is explicitly declared as a 'license';
    a second, where the statement is associated with a resource denoting only access rights;
    a third, covering all the other cases - i.e., statements not concerning licensing conditions and/or access rights (e.g., copyright statements).
  </p>

  <aside class="note">
    <p>
    The provision of licensing conditions and access rights complies with the Best Practices 4 ("<a data-cite="DWBP#licenses">Provide data license information</a>") and 22 ("<a data-cite="DWBP#DataUnavailabilityReference">Provide an explanation for data that is not available</a>"), respectively, from [[DWBP]].
  </p>
  </aside>

  <p>
    To address these scenarios, it is recommended to use the property <code>dcterms:rights</code>, and its sub-properties <code>dcterms:license</code> and <code>dcterms:accessRights</code>. More precisely:
  </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>use <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#http://purl.org/dc/terms/license"><code>dcterms:license</code></a> to refer to licenses;</p>

        <aside class="note">
          <p>
          For interoperability, it is recommended to use canonical IRIs of well-known licenses such as <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/">those defined by Creative Commons</a>.
        </p>
        </aside>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>use <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#http://purl.org/dc/terms/accessRights"><code>dcterms:accessRights</code></a>  to express statements concerning only access rights (e.g., whether data can be accessed by anyone or just by authorized parties);</p>

        <aside class="note">
          <p>
          Access rights can also be expressed as code lists / taxonomies. Examples include the access rights code list  [[?EUV-AR]] used in [[?DCAT-AP]] and the <a href="http://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/">Eprints Access Rights Vocabulary Encoding Scheme</a>.
        </p>
        </aside>

        <p>use <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#http://purl.org/dc/terms/rights"><code>dcterms:rights</code></a> for all the other types of rights statements - those which are not covered by <code>dcterms:license</code> and <code>dcterms:accessRights</code>, such as copyright statements.</p>

        <aside class="note">
          <p>
          A more sophisticated approach to express rights, based on and extending [[?DCTERMS]], is provided by the Open Data Rights Statement Vocabulary (ODRS) [[?ODRS]], which defines properties for specifying, among others, copyright statements and copyright notices.

Property <code>dcterms:rights</code> is used for the copyright statement, which is specified with a textual description, by using property <code>rdfs:label</code> (following the <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/resources/userguide/publishing_metadata/">Dublin Core™ User Guide</a>).</p>

  <p>Finally, in the particular case when rights are expressed via <a data-cite="ODRL-VOCAB#term-Policy">ODRL policies</a>, it is recommended to use the <a data-cite="ODRL-VOCAB#term-hasPolicy"><code>odrl:hasPolicy</code></a> property as the link from the description of the cataloged resource or distribution to the ODRL policy, in addition to the corresponding [[DCTERMS]] property that matches the same ODRL policy type.</p>

          The temporal extent of a dataset is given using <a href="#Property:dataset_temporal"><code title="http://purl.org/dc/terms/temporal">dcterms:temporal</code></a>.

<h2>Versioning</h2>

<!-- FIRST DRAFT IN DCAT3 FPWD

<p>Versioning can be applied to any of the first class citizens DCAT resources including Catalogs, Catalog Records, Datasets, Distributions. The notion of version is very much related to the community practices,  data management policy and the workflows in place. It is up to data providers to decide when and why a new version should be released. For this reason, DCAT refrains from providing definitions or rules about when changes in a resource should turn into a new release of it, and refer, for guidance, to [[?DWBP]] (<a data-cite="?DWBP#dataVersioning">&sect;&nbsp;<span class="secno">8.6 </span>Data Versioning</a>).</p>

<p>Versioning may be understood as involving relationships between datasets, which is supported by the <a href="#Property:resource_qualified_relation"><code>dcat:qualifiedRelation</code></a> and described in <a href="#qualified-relationship"></a>. The class <a href="#Class:Relationship"><code>dcat:Relationship</code></a> supports providing information about the relationship, and could be extended for versioning information.</p>

<aside class="ednote">
    <p>Second draft for discussion.</p>	   	
</aside>
    
<p>The following sections briefly discuss some key versioning aspects, and how they can be specified in DCAT records.</p>

<aside class="ednote">
<p><a href="#qualified-relationship"></a> and <a href="#examples-dataset-provenance"></a> should be revised in order to include aspects more specific to versioning.</p>
</aside>

<section id="version-types">
<h2>Version types</h2>

<div class="issue" data-number="1277"></div>    
    
<p>The creation of a version of a resource may have different motivations and purposes. For instance, the resource contains errors to be fixed, there may be new content to be added, or there may be a need to make the resource available in a different representation or language. Moreover, a new version may or may not replace the original resource.</p>
<p>Depending on these aspects, it is possible to identify different version types, which may correspond to different relationships. By following the approach used in the library domain, version types can be classified as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Each version <strong>replaces</strong> / <strong>supersedes</strong> the previous one, typically via a <strong>revision</strong>. E.g., this may include situations when a resource is revised to fix errors, add new content.</li>
<li>Each version is the <strong>successor</strong> of the previous one. In this case, a new version may or may not replace the previous one. An example is a project creating datasets providing statistics about air quality on, say, a yearly basis.</li>
<li>Versions provided <strong>in addition to</strong> the reference resource, without replacing it. In this case, versions may result in information loss. Examples includes abridgements (e.g., a summary), adaptations, transformations (to a different representations, formats, reference systems, measurements), translations.</li> 
</ol>

<aside class="ednote">
<p>The second type is partially related to the notion of dataset series (<a href="#dataset-series"></a>).</p>
</aside>
    
<p>These version types are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and they may overlap - especially, the first and the second ones. So, the relationship(s) used to link resource versions depends on which aspect is relevant for the specific use case. E.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>In same cases, the only relevant information is that resource <var>A</var> is a version of (<code>dcterms:isVersionOf</code> / <code>dcterms:hasVersion</code>) resource <var>B</var>, irrespective of the version type.</li>
<li>In other cases, it is important to explicitly state that resource <var>A</var> replaces (<code>dcterms:replaces</code> / <code>dcterms:isReplacedBy</code>) resource <var>B</var>, and that it is the result of a revision (<code>prov:wasRevisionOf</code> / <code>prov:hadRevision</code>).</li>
<li>Other cases may require having an explicit indication about which is the previous, next, and last version of a resource (<code>adms:prev</code>, <code>adms:next</code>, <code>adms:last</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>The third version type covers more heterogeneous cases, compared with the other version types. Depending on the application scenario, some or all of them may not be considered strictly related to versioning, but rather completely different resources, derived from other ones. E.g., the transformation of a distribution in additional formats (from CSV to XML and JSON), units of measurement, or coordinate reference systems, may be simply considered as alternative distributions associated with the same dataset. The same could be said for translations from one natural language to another one.</p>

<p>These cases can be addressed by using properties as <code>dcterms:source</code> and <code>prov:wasDerivedFrom</code> / <code>prov:hadDerivation</code>, as illustrated in <a href="#examples-dataset-provenance"></a> and <a href="#qualified-relationship"></a>. Moreover, for translations in natural language, property <a data-cite="VOCAB-ADMS#adms-translation"><code>adms:translation</code></a> could be used.</p>

<div class="issue" data-number="1331"></div>    

<aside class="ednote">
<p>This is a new draft for discussion on versioning support in DCAT.</p>
<p>Compared with the first draft in [[VOCAB-DCAT-3-20201217]], this section has been revised to focus specifically on versions derived from the revision of a resource, and by following the [[PAV]] approach for the specification of version chains and hierarchies - previous, next, current, last version.</p>
<p>In particular, the introductory text has been revised according to the new scope, the section on version types has been removed, and a new section has been added to describe how to specify relationships between versions, including those concerning backward compatibility, originally included in <a href="#version-info"></a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, <a href="#versioning-complementary-approaches">a new section</a> has been added at the end to compare the DCAT versioning approach with those used in OWL and [[?DCTERMS]].</p> 
<p>The other sections include only editorial changes.</p>
<p><strong>NB:</strong> All the properties described in this section are yet to be added to the RDF definition of DCAT.</p>
</aside>

<p>The notion of <em>version</em> is often used as a generic term to denote some kind of relationship between a resource and a derived one. Examples, among others, include revisions, editions, adaptations, and translations.</p>

<p>This section focuses specifically on how to use DCAT to describe versions resulting from a revision - i.e., from changes occurring to a resource as part of its life-cycle.</p>

<!--
<p>Henceforth, the words <em>version</em> and <em>versioning</em> must be intended in this restrictive sense.</p>
-->

<p>For this purpose, DCAT builds upon existing vocabularies, in particular the versioning component of the [[?PAV]] ontology, and the relevant terms from [[?DCTERMS]], [[?OWL2-OVERVIEW]], and [[?VOCAB-ADMS]].</p>

<p>It is important to note that versioning can be applied to any of the first class citizens DCAT resources, including Catalogs, Catalog Records, Datasets, Distributions.</p>

<p>Note also that the DCAT approach described in the following sections is meant to be complementary with those already used in specific types of resources (e.g., [[OWL2-OVERVIEW]] provides a set of versioning properties for ontologies), as well as in given domains and communities. For a comparison between the DCAT versioning approach and those of other vocabularies, see <a href="#versioning-complementary-approaches"></a>.</p> 

<aside class="note">

<section id="version-relationships">

<h2>Relationships between versions</h2>

<p>DCAT supports the following kinds of relationships between versions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those indicating the version chain and hierarchy (the version history).</li>
<li>Those indicating whether a version is replaced/superseded by another one.</li>
<!--
<li>Those indicating whether a version is backward compatible with another one.</li>
-->
</ol>

<section id="version-history">

<h2>Version chains and hierarchies</h2>

<p>DCAT defines specific properties for describing version history, aligned with the corresponding [[?PAV]] ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#Property:resource_previous_version"><code>dcat:previousVersion</code></a> (equivalent to <a data-cite="?PAV#d4e459"><code>pav:previousVersion</code></a>)</li>
<!--
<li><p><a href="#Property:resource_has_version"><code>dcat:hasVersion</code></a> (equivalent to <a data-cite="?PAV#d4e395"><code>pav:hasVersion</code></a>), plus the following additional properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#Property:resource_is_version_of"><code>dcat:isVersionOf</code></a> (inverse of <code>dcat:hasVersion</code>);</li>
<li><a href="#Property:resource_has_current_version"><code>dcat:hasCurrentVersion</code></a> (equivalent to <a data-cite="?PAV#d4e359"><code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code></a>, and subproperty of <code>dcat:hasVersion</code>)</li>
-->
<li><p><a href="#Property:resource_has_version"><code>dcat:hasVersion</code></a> (equivalent to <a data-cite="?PAV#d4e395"><code>pav:hasVersion</code></a>);</p>
<li><a href="#Property:resource_has_current_version"><code>dcat:hasCurrentVersion</code></a> (equivalent to <a data-cite="?PAV#d4e359"><code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code></a>, and subproperty of <code>dcat:hasVersion</code>).</li>
<!--
<li><a href="#Property:resource_has_last_version"><code>dcat:hasLastVersion</code></a> (subproperty of <code>dcat:hasVersion</code>)</li>
-->
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<aside class="ednote">
<p>The previous draft [[VOCAB-DCAT-3-20201217]] was making use of similar properties from [[DCTERMS]] and [[VOCAB-ADMS]], namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>dcterms:hasVersion</code> / <code>dcterms:isVersionOf</code>, for version hierarchies, and</li>
<li><code>adms:prev</code>, <code>adms:next</code>, <code>adms:last</code> for both versions chains and dataset series.</li>
</ul>
<p>Their definitions and use do not however fit completely with similar properties in [[PAV]]. E.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#http://purl.org/dc/terms/hasVersion"><code>dcterms:hasVersion</code></a> is defined as <q>A related resource that is a version, edition, or adaptation of the described resource</q>, thus using the notion of version in its wider sense, whereas [[PAV]] is specifically describing versions as the result of a revision.</li>
<li><a data-cite="VOCAB-ADMS#adms-last"><code>adms:last</code></a> is defined as <q>A link to the current or latest version of the Asset</q>, whereas in [[PAV]] the current and latest versions of a resource may be different, and link to by using different properties.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, although the definitions of the [[VOCAB-ADMS]] properties states explicitly that they are meant to be used for "versions", they are subproperties of the corresponding terms in [[XHTML-VOCAB]], where they are used to link resources in a collection (e.g., the set of pages of a Web site). E.g., the definition of <a data-cite="XHTML-VOCAB#last"><code>xhv:last</code></a> reads as follows: <q>last refers to the last resource in a collection of resources.</q>.</p>
<p>Based on that, in this draft, [[PAV]]-equivalent properties are used for versions, whereas the [[VOCAB-ADMS]] properties, and properties <code>dcterms:hasVersion</code> / <code>dcterms:isVersionOf</code> are not used.</p>
</aside>

<p>Property <code>dcat:previousVersion</code> is used to build a version chain, that can be navigated backward from a given version to the first one. This reflects the most typical use case - i.e., linking different versions published as distinct resources in a catalog.</p>

<p>In addition to this, property <code>dcat:hasVersion</code> can be used to specify a version hierarchy, by linking an abstract resource to its versions.</p>

<!--
<p>If needed, the version hierarchy can be further described by specific properties. More precisely, property <code>dcat:isVersionOf</code> (inverse of <code>dcat:hasVersion</code>) gives the possibility of specifying a back link from a version to the abstract resource, whereas property <code>dcat:hasCurrentVersion</code> link an abstract resource to snapshot corresponding to the current version of the content.</p>

Finally, property <code>dcat:hasLastVersion</code> link the abstract resource to the latest version of the resource in the version chain. Note that the current version of a resource may be different from the last version: e.g., if the last version is still in draft status, the current one may correspond to the latest stable version of the resource.</p>

<p><a href="#fig-version-chain-and-hierarchy"></a> illustrates the use of <em>all</em> these properties. In the figure, the resource with IRI <code>https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat</code> is an abstract resource, corresponding always to the latest  stable version of DCAT (as W3C Recommendation), whereas the other ones correspond to specific versions of DCAT.

<p>Note that the only properties necessary to specify a version chain and hierarchy are, respectively, <code>dcat:previousVersion</code> and <code>dcat:hasVersion</code>. Whether to use or not the other ones depends on the requirements of the relevant use case.</p>

<p>The following example reuses those in <a data-cite="?DWBP#dataVersioning">&sect;&nbsp;<span class="secno">8.6 </span>Data Versioning</a> of [[DWBP]] and revises them to show how to specify a version chain and hierarchy on a bus stops dataset, by using the properties described in this section.</p>

<aside class="example" id="ex-version-chain-and-hierarchy" title="Version history of the MyCity bus stops dataset">

<p>The MyCity bus stops dataset is updated whenever the list of bus stops changes.

<p>In <a href="#fig-version-chain-and-hierarchy"></a>, the resource with IRI <code>mycity-bus:stops</code> is the abstract resource, corresponding always to the latest version of the MyCity bus stops dataset, whereas the other ones correspond to specific versions of it.

<h2>Versions replaced by other ones</h2>

<p>Another type of relationship concerns whether a given version replaces/supersedes another one. For this purpose, DCAT reuses the relevant [[DCTERMS]] property, namely, <a href="#Property:resource_replaces"><code title="http://purl.org/dc/terms/replaces">dcterms:replaces</code></a>, plus its inverse <code title="http://purl.org/dc/terms/isReplacedBy">dcterms:isReplacedBy</code>, in case a back link needs to be provided.</p>

<h2>Version backward compatibility</h2>

<p>Two typical examples are (a) a textual description of the changes between the current and the previous version of a resource, and (b) whether the new version of the resource is backward compatible or not with the previous version (this is particularly relevant when the resource is used by given applications, so it is fundamental to know if the new version can be also used with them).</p>

<section id="life-cycle">

<h2>Resource life-cycle</h2>

<p>The life-cycle of a resource is an aspect orthogonal to versioning, and sometimes strictly related. The evolution of a resource along its life-cycle (from its conception, to its creation and publication) may result in new versions, although this is not always the case (e.g., in case an approval workflow is in place, the resource may not undergo any change if no revision is needed). Similarly, the creation of a new version may not necessarily lead to a change in status (e.g., when changes are not substantial, and/or are implemented on resources still in development). Moreover, when a resource is replaced because of a revision (correcting errors, adding new content, etc.), it may be moved to a different life-cycle status (e.g., deprecation or withdrawl).</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the status of a resource with respect to its life-cycle is often an important piece of information by itself, from both the data provider's and data consumers' perspectives. For a data consumer, it is important to know if a resource is still in development or not, as well as if it is deprecated or withdrawn (and, in such cases, if there is a new version to be used). On the other hand, for a data provider, flagging a resource with its status in the life-cycle is fundamental for the correct administration of the data management workflow. E.g., a resource before being published may need to be stable, and possibly flagged as approved and/or registered. Finally, besides the actual status of a resource, another useful piece of information is <em>when</em> the resource moved to a different status (e.g., when it was created, reviewed, accepted, published).</p>

<p>As for versioning, the resource life-cycle depends on community practices, data management policies, and the workflows in place. Moreover, different resource types (e.g., datasets vs catalog records) may have different life-cycle statuses.</p>

<p>For the specification of life-cycle statuses, DCAT makes use of property <a href="#Property:resource_status"><code>adms:status</code></a> [[?VOCAB-ADMS]], along with the appropriate [[?DCTERMS]] time-related properties (<code>dcterms:created</code>, <code>dcterms:dateSubmitted</code>, <code>dcterms:dateAccepted</code>, <code>dcterms:dateCopyrighted</code>, <a href="#Property:resource_release_date"><code>dcterms:issued</code></a>, <a href="#Property:resource_update_date"><code>dcterms:modified</code></a>, <code>dcterms:valid</code>). However, DCAT does not prescribe the use of any specific set of life-cycle statuses, but refers to existing standards and community practices fit for the relevant application scenario.</p>

<aside class="note">
<p>Examples of life-cycle statuses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those defined in the ISO standard for item registration [[?ISO-19135]] (accepted / not accepted, deprecated, experimental, reserved, retired, stable, submitted, superseded, valid / invalid).</li>
<li>The progress codes defined in [[?ISO-19115]] (accepted, completed, deprecated, final, historical archive, not accepted, obsolete, ongoing, pending, planned, proposed, required, retired, superseded, tentative, under development, valid, withdrawn).</li>
<!--
<li>[[?DCTERMS]], which supports a number of relevant time-related properties (<code>dcterms:created</code>, <code>dcterms:dateSubmitted</code>, <code>dcterms:dateAccepted</code>, <code>dcterms:dateCopyrighted</code>, <code>dcterms:issued</code>, <code>dcterms:modified</code>, <code>dcterms:valid</code>).</li>

<h2>Complementary approaches to versioning</h2>

<p>The DCAT versioning approach can coexist with existing versioning practices - as those used in specific communities, domains, and resource types.</p>

<p>As an example, the following table shows the correspondences between the DCAT versioning properties and the vocabularies most frequently used to specify similar concepts, namely, OWL, for ontologies, [[?DCTERMS]], and [[?PROV-O]].</p>

<p>Note that correspondence does not imply equivalence. These properties have different scopes and semantics, and therefore they can complement but not replace each other. In particular, OWL properties are meant to be used on resources that can be typed as <code>owl:Ontology</code>'s, whereas the [[?DCTERMS]] ones use a very broad notion of <em>version</em> (including editions and adaptations). On the other hand, DCAT versioning properties are meant to be used on any resource in a catalog, and they use a very specific notion of <em>version</em>, as explained in the introduction to <a href="#dataset-versions"></a>. Finally, the [[?PROV-O]] property <code>prov:wasRevisionOf</code>, although semantically similar to <code>dcat:previousVersion</code>, is not explicitly meant to be used to build a version chain, whereas <code>prov:generalizationOf</code> and <code>prov:specializationOf</code> are semantically broader than their sub-properties <code>dcat:hasVersion</code> and <code>dcat:isVersionOf</code>, respectively.</p>

<p>The following example shows how DCAT and OWL can be used complementarily to versioning [[?VOCAB-DCAT-2]].</p>

<h2>Dataset series</h2>

<aside class="ednote">
<p>This is a new draft for discussion on dataset series support in DCAT. Compared with the first draft in [[VOCAB-DCAT-3-20201217]], this section has been revised.</p>
<p>A new class <code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code> is defined as suggested in Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/1272">#1272</a>. </p>
<p>Only one property  <code>dcat:inSeries</code> linking the child datasets to dataset series is defined. The new property <code>dcat:inSeries</code> replaces the use of <code>dcterms:isPartOf</code> helping to distinguish between the composition in dataset series and  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#examples-bag-of-files">Loosely structured catalog</a> (see Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/1307">#1307</a>). Finally, properties <code>adms:prev</code>, <code>adms:next</code>, and <code>adms:last</code> have been replaced by newly defined properties - <code>dcat:prev</code>, <code>dcat:next</code>, and <code>dcat:last</code> (see Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/1308">#1308</a>)).</p>
</aside>

<p>With "dataset series" we refer to data, somehow interrelated, that are published separately. An example is budget data split by year and/or country, instead of being made available in a single dataset.</p>

<p>Dataset series are defined in [[ISO-19115]] as a <q>collection of datasets [&hellip;] sharing common characteristics</q>. However, their use is not limited to geospatial data, although in other domains they can be named differently (e.g., time series, data slices) and defined more or less strictly (see, e.g., the notion of "dataset slice" in [[VOCAB-DATA-CUBE]]).</p>

<p>The reasons and criteria for grouping datasets into series are manyfold, and they may be related to, e.g., data characteristics, publishing process, and how they are typically used. For instance, data huge in size (as geospatial ones) are more easily handled (by data providers as well as data consumers) by splitting them into smaller ones. Another example is data released on a yearly basis, which are typically published as separate datasets, instead of appending the new data to the first in the series.</p>

<p>As there are no common rules and criteria across domains to decide when dataset series should be created and how they should be organized, DCAT does not prescribe any specific approach, and refer for guidance and domain- and community practices. The purpose of this section is limited to providing guidance on how dataset series can be specified in DCAT.</p>

<section id="dataset-series-specification">

<h2>How to specify dataset series</h2>

<p>DCAT makes dataset series first class citizens of data catalogs by minting a new class <a href="#Class:Dataset_Series"><code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code></a>, defined as subclass of <a href="#Class:Dataset"><code>dcat:Dataset</code></a>. 
The datasets are linked to dataset series by using the property <a href="#Property:dataset_in_series"><code>dcat:inSeries</code></a>. 
<!-- The dataset series and the child datasets are linked by using the [[DCTERMS]] property <a href="#Property:dataset_series_series_member"><code>dcat:seriesMember</code></a> and/or its inverse <a href="#Property:dataset_in_series"><code>dcat:inSeries</code></a>.

    Note that a dataset series can also be hierachical, and a dataset series can be member of another dataset series.</p>

<p>Dataset series may evolve over time, by acquiring new datasets. E.g., a dataset series about yearly budget data will acquire a new child dataset every year. In such cases, it might be important to link the yearly releases with relationships specifying the first, previous, next, and latest ones. In such scenario, DCAT makes use of properties <a href="#Property:resource_first"><code>dcat:first</code></a>, <a href="#Property:resource_previous"><code>dcat:prev</code></a>, and <a href="#Property:resource_last"><code>dcat:last</code></a>, respectively.

<h2>Dataset series metadata</h2>

<div class="issue" data-number="1273"></div>

<!--
    <p>A dataset series can be seen as the result of subsetting (or slicing) a single dataset based on the values of one or more metadata element. E.g., a statistical dataset about employment may be split into smaller datasets about the same age-group and/or gender.</p>

<p>Although any metadata element can be used for subsetting, the most frequent cases concern the spatial and temporal dimensions. Re-using the example of budget data, the dataset can be split not only by year, but also by country / region. Other examples concerns child datasets using different temporal / spatial resolution, unit of measurement, or reference system.</p>

<p>Because of its role of "container", the dimensions described in child dataset metadata should be reflected in the dataset series, via upstream inheritance - i.e., properties of child datasets are inherited by their parent (the dataset series).</p>

<p>Typically, this means that, for each of the relevant properties, the dataset series takes as value the union of those specified in child datasets. For instance:</p>-->

<p>Properties about dataset series can be classified into two groups.</p>

<p>The first group is about properties describing the dataset series itself. For instance, this is the case of property <a href="#Property:dataset_frequency"><code>dcterms:accrualPeriodicity</code></a>, whose value should correspond to the frequency upon which a new child dataset is added.</p>

<p>The second group is about properties reflecting the dimensions described in child dataset metadata, via upstream inheritance - i.e., property values of child datasets are inherited by their parent (the dataset series).</p>

<p>Typically, this means that, for each of the relevant properties, the dataset series takes as value the union of those specified in child datasets. For instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the temporal coverage of child datasets is a different year, e.g., 2018, 2019, 2020, the temporal coverage of the series will be the time period between years 2018 and 2020.</li>
<li>If child datasets have a different geographic bounding box as spatial coverage, the spatial coverage of the series will be the union of these bounding boxes (i.e., a bounding box including the ones of the child datasets).</li>
<li>If each child dataset uses a different spatial reference system, the dataset series will have multiple spatial reference systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, some annotation properties of child datasets may need to be taken into account as well at the level of dataset series. In particular, properties concerning the creation / publication / update dates of child datasets may affect the corresponding ones in the series. For these properties, DCAT recommends the following approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>The creation date (<code>dcterms:created</code>) of the dataset series should correspond to the earliest creation date of the child datasets.</li>
<li>The publication date (<a href="#Property:resource_release_date"><code>dcterms:issued</code></a>) of the dataset series should correspond to the earliest publication date of the child datasets.</li>
<li>The update date (<a href="#Property:resource_update_date"><code>dcterms:modified</code></a>) of the dataset series should correspond to the latest publication or update date of the child datasets.</li>
</ul>

<aside class="note">
<p>To ensure dataset series metadata be correct and updated, mechanisms can be put in place to implement upstream inheritance automatically. However, DCAT does not recommend any specific strategy to be adopted.</p>
</aside>

<aside class="example" id="ex-dataset-series-properties" title="Dataset series metadata">
<p>The following example is a variant <a href="#ex-dataset-series-releases"></a>, with child datasets corresponding to yearly budget data for specific countries. The temporal resolution (<code>dcat:temporalResolution</code>), temporal coverage (<code>dcat:temporal</code>), and spatial coverage (<code>dcat:spatial</code>) of the dataset series correspond to the union of those of the child datasets. Moreover, the dataset series specifies as publication date the one of the first published child dataset, whereas the date of publication of the last child dataset is specified as update date (<code>dcterms:modified</code>). Finally, the update frequency (<code>dcterms:accrualPeriodicity</code>) of the dataset series is annual, as the child datasets are published on a yearly basis.</p>

<h2>Dataset series in existing DCAT implementations</h2>

<aside class="ednote">
<p>To be decided whether to keep or not this section.</p>
</aside>

<p>Existing DCAT implementations adopt two main alternative approaches to specifying dataset series:</p>

<ol>
<li>The dataset series is typed as a <code>dcat:Dataset</code>, whereas its child datasets are typed as <code>dcat:Distribution</code>'s.</li>
<li>Both the dataset series and its child datasets are typed as a <code>dcat:Dataset</code>'s, and the two are usually linked by using the [[DCTERMS]] properties <code>dcterms:hasPart</code> / <code>dcterms:isPartOf</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>In both cases, the dataset series is sometimes soft-typed by using the [[DCTERMS]] property <code>dcterms:type</code> (e.g., this is the approach used in [[?GeoDCAT-AP]], and adopted in [[?DCAT-AP-IT]] and [[?GeoDCAT-AP-IT]]).</p>

<p>These options are not formally incompatible with DCAT, so they can cohexist with <code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code> during the upgrade to DCAT 3.</p>

<!--
<p>Compared with the second option, the first one may have the advantage of simplifying metadata management, and avoiding the creation of datasets having the same values for almost all their metadata elements. On the other hand, this approach reduces the ability of being discovered, as distribution metadata are not rich as datasets' ones. Moreover, using distributions may result cumbersome or unfeasible when the number of child datasets is too high.</p>

<p>The approach based on the use of <code>dcat:Distribution</code> for typing child datasets is however recognized as a possible alternative, whenever it addresses more effectively the requirements of a given application scenario.</p>

        and credit to those producing the data, facilitating data discovery, supporting tracking the impact and reuse of data, allowing for
        collaboration and re-use of data, and enabling the reproducibility of results based on the data.
    </p>

    <p>
        To support data citation, the dataset description should include at a minimum: the dataset identifier, the dataset creator(s), the dataset title,
        the dataset publisher and the dataset publication or release date. These elements are those required by the DataCite metadata schema [[?DataCite]],
        which is the metadata associated by the persistent identifiers (Digital Object Identifiers or DOIs) assigned by [[?DataCite]] to research data.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to support data citation, this DCAT revision has added the consideration of <a href="#dereferenceable-identifiers">dereferenceable identifiers</a> and support for indicating
        <a href="#Property:resource_creator">the creators of the cataloged resources</a>. The remaining properties necessary for data citation were already available in DCAT 1 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]].
    </p>

    <p>
        The constraints on the availability of properties required for data citation in the dataset description can be represented as a DCAT data citation profile.

    <h2>Quality information</h2>
    <aside class="note">
      <p>This section is non-normative as it provides guidance on how to document the quality of DCAT
      first class entities (e.g., datasets, distributions) and it does not define new DCAT terms. The guidance relies on the
      Data Quality Vocabulary (DQV) [[?VOCAB-DQV]], which is a W3C Group Note.</p>
    </aside>

    <p>The Data Quality Vocabulary (DQV) [[?VOCAB-DQV]] offers common modelling patterns for different aspects of Data
    Quality.
    It can relate  DCAT datasets and distributions with different types of quality information including:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dqv/#dqv:QualityAnnotation"><code>dqv:QualityAnnotation</code></a>, which represents feedback and quality certificates given about the dataset or its distribution.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dqv/#dqv:QualityPolicy"><code>dqv:QualityPolicy</code></a>, which represents a policy or agreement that is chiefly governed by data quality concerns.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dqv/#dqv:QualityMeasurement"><code>dqv:QualityMeasurement</code></a>, which represents a metric value providing quantitative or qualitative information about the dataset or distribution.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each type of quality information can pertain to one or more quality dimensions, namely, quality characteristics relevant
    to the consumer. The practice to see the quality as a multi-dimensional space is consolidated in the field of quality
    management to split the quality management into addressable chunks. DQV does not define a normative list of quality
    dimensions. It offers the quality dimensions proposed in ISO/IEC 25012 [[?ISO-IEC-25012]] and [[?ZaveriEtAl]]
    as two possible starting points. It also provides an <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ldqd">RDF representation</a>
    for the quality dimensions and categories defined in the latter. Ultimately, implementers will need to choose themselves
    the collection of quality dimensions that best fits their needs.
    The following section shows how DCAT and DQV can be coupled to describe the quality of datasets and distributions.
    For a comprehensive introduction  and further examples of use, please refer to [[?VOCAB-DQV]].</p>

    <aside class="note">
        <p>The following examples make no comments on where the quality information would reside and how it is managed. That
  is out of scope for the DCAT vocabulary.  The assumption made is that the quality individuals are available using
  the IRIs indicated.
        Besides, the examples and more in general the [[?VOCAB-DQV]]  is neutral to the data portal design choices on how to collect
  quality information. For example, data portals can collect [[?VOCAB-DQV]] instances by implementing specific UI to annotate
  data or by taking inputs from 3rd-party services.

<!-- @andrea-perego: added proposed example on how to specify a dataset's CRS -->

<p>Another example concerns the specification of the coordinate reference system (CRS) used in a dataset - an information which is typically included in geospatial metadata. <a href="#ex-dataset-crs"></a> shows how the CRS of a dataset can be specified in DCAT:</p>

<aside class="example" id="ex-dataset-crs">
<pre class="nohighlight turtle">
:Dataset-2 a dcat:Dataset;
  dcterms:conformsTo &lt;http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/28992&gt; .</pre>
</aside>

<p>In <a href="#ex-dataset-crs"></a>, <code>http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/28992</code> is a IRI from the OGC CRS Registry, corresponding to <a href="http://www.epsg-registry.org/?display=entity&amp;urn=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::28992">EPSG:28992</a> ("Amersfoort / RD New") (see also <a href="#ex-spatial-coverage-geometry-with-crs"></a>).</p>

<aside class="note">
<p>The provision of a resource CRS complies with Best Practice&nbsp;8 (<a data-cite="SDW-BP#bp-crs">State how coordinate values are encoded</a>) from [[SDW-BP]].</p>
</aside>


<p>In order to ensure interoperability, it is important to consistently use the IRIs identifying the reference standards / specifications. In particular, DCAT recommends the following general rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use IRIs from reference registries, when available. Examples include the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/">W3C TR registry</a>, the <a href="https://www.ogc.org/def-server">OGC Definitions Server</a>, the <a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui">ISO OBP</a>.</li>
<li>Use the IRI of the standard / specification, and not the namespace IRI. E.g., to express conformance with DCAT, the IRI to be used is <code>https://www.w3.org.org/TR/vocab-dcat/</code>, and not <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#</code>.</p>
<li>Use the canonical, persistent IRI. This is usually specified in the document itself. If you are in doubt, use the one included in the bibliographic citations for that standard / specification.</li>
<li>Use the non-versioned IRI. If you need to express conformance with a specific version of the standard / specification, use both the un-versioned and the versioned IRI. E.g., in case you need to explictly state conformance with DCAT 2, use both <code>https://www.w3.org.org/TR/vocab-dcat/</code> and <code>https://www.w3.org.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/</code>.</li>
</ul>

            <h3>Degree of conformance</h3>
            <p>Some legal context requires to specify the degree of conformance. For example, INSPIRE metadata adopts a
      specific controlled vocabulary [[?INSPIRE-DoC]]
      to express non-conformance and non-evaluation beside the full compliance. Similar controlled vocabularies can
      be defined in other contexts.</p>
      <p><a href="#ex-conformance-degree"></a> specifies some newly minted concepts representing the degree of conformance (i.e., conformant, not conformant) and  declares the
      <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#http://purl.org/dc/terms/type"><code>dcterms:type</code></a> for indicating
      the result of conformance test. Following a pattern used in [[?GeoDCAT-AP]], the example uses a <code>prov:Entity</code> to model the  conformance test (e.g.,
      <code>a:testResult</code>), a <code>prov:Activity</code> to model the testing activity (e.g.,
      <code>a:testingActivity</code>), a <code>prov:Plan</code> derived from the Data on the Web Best Practices [[?DWBP]] (e.g., <code>a:conformanceTest</code>) to check for the whole set of best practices. A qualified PROV association binds the testing activity to the conformance test.</p>

      <aside class="note">
      <p>Depending of the kind of dataset, other best practices and standards, such as the FAIR Principles [[?FAIR]] or the Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices [[?SDW-BP]], can be considered as a replacement or used in combination with [[?DWBP]].</p>

  <h2>Qualified relations</h2>

  <p>
    DCAT includes elements to support description of many aspects of datasets and data-services. Nevertheless, additional information is required in order to fully express the semantics of some relationships. An example is that, while [[!DCTERMS]] provides the standard roles <b>creator</b>, <b>contributor</b> and <b>publisher</b> for attribution of a resource to a responsible party or agent, there are many other potential roles, see for example the <a href="https://standards.iso.org/iso/19115/resources/Codelists/gml/CI_RoleCode.xml"><code>CI_RoleCode</code></a> values from [[?ISO-19115-1]]. Similarly, while [[!DCTERMS]] and [[!PROV-O]] provide some properties to capture relationships between resources, including <b>was derived from</b>, <b>was quoted from</b>, <b>is version of</b>, <b>references</b> and several others, many additional concerns are seen in the list of [[?ISO-19115-1]] <a href="https://standards.iso.org/iso/19115/resources/Codelists/gml/DS_AssociationTypeCode.xml"><code>DS_AssociationTypeCodes</code></a>, the IANA Registry of Link Relations [[?IANA-RELATIONS]], the DataCite metadata schema [[?DataCite]]
    and the <a href="https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators">MARC relators</a>. While these relations could be captured with additional sub-properties of <code>dcterms:relation</code>, <code>dcterms:contributor</code>, etc, this would lead to an explosion in the number of properties, and anyway the full set of potential roles and relationships is unknown.
  </p>
  <p>
    A common approach for meeting these kinds of requirement is to introduce an additional resource to carry parameters that qualify the relationship. Precedents are the <a data-cite="?PROV-O#description-qualified-terms">qualified terms</a> in [[?PROV-O]] and the <a data-cite="?VOCAB-SSN#Sample_Relations">sample relations</a> in the Semantic Sensor Network ontology [[?VOCAB-SSN]]. The general <a href="http://patterns.dataincubator.org/book/qualified-relation.html">Qualified Relation pattern</a> is described in [[?LinkedDataPatterns]].
  </p>
  <p>
    Many of the qualified terms from [[!PROV-O]] are relevant to the description of resources in catalogs but these are incomplete due to the activity-centric viewpoint taken by PROV-O. Addressing some of the gaps, additional forms are included in the DCAT vocabulary to satisfy requirements that do not involve explicit activities. These are summarized in <a href="#fig-dcat-relationships"></a>:
  </p>

  <figure id="fig-dcat-relationships"><img alt="UML model of DCAT qualified relationships" src="images/dcat-relationships.svg">
      <figcaption>
          Qualified relationships support an extensible set of roles relating resources to agents or to other resources
      </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Note that, while the focus of these qualified forms is to allow for additional <i>roles</i> on a relationship, other aspect of the relationships, such as the applicable time interval, are easily attached when a specific node is used to describe the relationship like this (e.g. see the <a data-cite="?PROV-O#qualified-terms-figure">chart of Influence relations</a> in [[?PROV-O]] for some examples).
  </p>
  
  <aside class="note">
    <p>
    Because of the global domain constraints on <a data-cite="PROV-O#qualifiedAttribution"><code>prov:qualifiedAttribution</code></a> and the super-property of <a href="#Property:resource_qualified_relation"><code>dcat:qualifiedRelation</code></a>, use of the qualified forms entail that the context resource is a member of the class <a data-cite="PROV-O#Entity"><code>prov:Entity</code></a> [[RDF-SCHEMA]].

  <h3>Relationships between datasets and agents</h3>

    The standard [[!DCTERMS]] properties <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/contributor"><code>dcterms:contributor</code></a>, <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator"><code>dcterms:creator</code></a> and <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/publisher"><code>dcterms:publisher</code></a>, and the generic <a data-cite="!PROV-O#wasAttributedTo"><code>prov:wasAttributedTo</code></a> from [[!PROV-O]], support basic associations of responsible agents with a cataloged resource.
    However, there are many other roles of importance in relation to datasets and services - e.g. funder, distributor, custodian, editor.
    Some of these roles are enumerated in the <a href="https://standards.iso.org/iso/19115/resources/Codelists/gml/CI_RoleCode.xml"><code>CI_RoleCode</code></a> values from [[?ISO-19115-1]], in the [[?DataCite]] metadata schema, and included within the <a href="https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators">MARC relators</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A general method for assigning an agent to a resource with a specified role is provided by using the qualified form <a data-cite="?PROV-O#qualifiedAttribution"><code>prov:qualifiedAttribution</code></a> from [[!PROV-O]].

    <h2>DCAT Profiles</h2>

    <p>
        The DCAT-2014 vocabulary [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] has been extended for application in data catalogs in different domains.
        Each of these new specifications constitutes a DCAT profile, i.e. a named set of constraints based on DCAT (see <a href="#conformance"></a>). In some cases,
        a profile extends one of the DCAT profiles themselves, by adding classes and properties for metadata fields not covered in the reference DCAT profile.
    </p>

  <p>Some of the DCAT profiles are:</p>

  <ul>
            <li>DCAT-AP [[?DCAT-AP]]: The <cite>DCAT application profile for data portals in Europe</cite></li>
            <li>GeoDCAT-AP [[?GeoDCAT-AP]]: Geospatial profile of [[?DCAT-AP]]</li>
            <li>StatDCAT-AP [[?StatDCAT-AP]]: Statistical profile of [[?DCAT-AP]]</li>
            <li>DCAT-AP_IT [[?DCAT-AP-IT]]: Italian profile of [[?DCAT-AP]]</li>
            <li>GeoDCAT-AP_IT [[?GeoDCAT-AP-IT]]: Italian profile of [[?GeoDCAT-AP]]</li>
            <li>DCAT-AP-NO [[?DCAT-AP-NO]]: Norwegian profile of [[?DCAT-AP]]</li>
            <li>DCAT-AP.de [[?DCAT-AP.de]]: German profile of [[?DCAT-AP]]</li>
            <li>DCAT-BE [[?DCAT-BE]]: Belgian profile of [[?DCAT-AP]]</li>
            <li>DCAT-AP-SE [[?DCAT-AP-SE]]: Swedish profile of [[?DCAT-AP]]</li>
        </ul>

</section>

<section id="security_and_privacy">
    <h2>Security and Privacy</h2>
    <p>
    The DCAT vocabulary supports the attribution of data and metadata to various participants such as resource <a href="#Property:resource_creator">creators</a>, <a href="#Property:resource_publisher">publishers</a> and other parties or agents via <a href="#qualified-forms">qualified relations</a>,
      and as such defines terms that may be related to personal information.  In addition, it also supports the association of <a href="#Property:resource_rights">rights</a> and <a href="#Property:resource_license">licenses</a> with cataloged Resources and Distributions.
      These rights and licenses could potentially include or reference sensitive information such as user and asset identifiers as <a data-cite="?ODRL-VOCAB#privacy-consideration">described</a> in [[!ODRL-VOCAB]].   Implementations that produce, maintain, publish or
      consume such vocabulary terms must take steps to ensure security and privacy considerations are addressed at the application level.
    </p>
</section>
<section id="accessibility">
    <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>
    <p>
    The DCAT vocabulary provides a model for describing data catalogs. The nature of data in the catalogs depends on the specific domains of application and might include non-text data.  When possible, it is important to enforce alternative text for non-text data resources through the DCAT profile mechanisms or systems supporting the creation and editing of such data to improve the accessibility to data. The practice to provide text alternatives for any non-text content, which can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols, or simpler language complies with accessibility guidelines included in [[UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20]].

        <h2>Alignment with Schema.org</h2>
        
    <aside class="note">
      <p>
        See the issues on <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/labels/alignment">Alignments and Crosswalks</a> for more discussion.

        <p>
            Schema.org [[?SCHEMA-ORG]] includes a number of types and properties based on the original DCAT work (see <a href="https://schema.org/Dataset">sdo:Dataset</a> as a starting point),
            and the index for Google's <a href="https://g.co/datasetsearch">Dataset Search service</a> relies on structured description in Web pages about datasets using both
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/dataset">schema.org and DCAT</a>.
            A comparison of the DCAT backbone, shown in <a href="#fig-dcat-all-attributes"></a> above with the related classes from [[?SCHEMA-ORG]] in <a href="#UML_SchemaOrg_Data_Cat"></a> shows the similarity, in particular: .
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            the distinction between (abstract) Dataset and (concrete) DataDownload matches  dcat:Dataset / dcat:Distribution
          </li>
          <li>
            the relationship of Datasets to DataCatalogs
          </li>
        </ul>
        <figure id="UML_SchemaOrg_Data_Cat"><img alt="UML model of schema.org classes and properties related to dataset catalogs" src="images/schema.org-dataset.svg">
            <figcaption>
                schema.org support for dataset catalogs, showing a selection of schema.org properties related to the classes shown

        </figure>
        <p>
            General purpose Web search services that use metadata at all rely primarily on [[?SCHEMA-ORG]], so the relationship of DCAT to [[?SCHEMA-ORG]] is of interest for data providers and catalog publishers who wish their datasets and services to be exposed through those indexes.
        </p>
        <p>
            A <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/Datasets">mapping between DCAT 1 and schema.org</a> was discussed on the original proposal to extend [[?SCHEMA-ORG]] for describing datasets and data catalogs.
            Partial mappings between DCAT 1 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] and [[?SCHEMA-ORG]] were provided earlier by the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/wiki/ISO_19115_-_DCAT_-_Schema.org_mapping">Spatial Data on the Web Working Group</a>, building upon previous work.
        </p>
        <p>
            A recommended mapping from the revised DCAT (this document) to [[?SCHEMA-ORG]] version 3.4 is <a href="https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/dcat/rdf/dcat-schema.ttl">available in an RDF file</a>.
            This mapping is axiomatized using the predicates <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code>, <code>rdfs:subPropertyOf</code>, <code>owl:equivalentClass</code>, <code>owl:equivalentProperty</code>, <code>skos:closeMatch</code>,
            and also using the annotation properties <code>sdo:domainIncludes</code> and <code>sdo:rangeIncludes</code> to match [[?SCHEMA-ORG]] semantics. The alignment is summarized in the table below, considering the prefix <code>sdo</code> as <code>http://schema.org/</code>.
        </p>
        <!--backlog p class="issue" data-number="251">

      <p>
          In many legacy catalogs and repositories (e.g. CKAN), ‘datasets’ are ‘just a bag of files’. There is no distinction made between distribution (representation), and other kinds of relationship (e.g. documentation, schema, supporting documents) from the dataset to each of the files.
      </p>
      <p>
          If the nature of the relationships between a dataset and component resources in a catalog, repository, or elsewhere are not known, <code>dcterms:relation</code> or its sub-property <code>dcterms:hasPart</code> can be used:

          Several properties capture provenance information, including within the citation and title, but the primary link to a formal description of the project is through <a href="#Property:dataset_was_generated_by"><code>prov:wasGeneratedBy</code></a>.
          A terse description of the project is shown as a <a data-cite="PROV-O#Activity"><code>prov:Activity</code></a>, though this would not necessarily be part of the same catalog.
          Note that as the project is ongoing, the activity has no end date.
      </p>
      <p>
          Further provenance information might be provided using the other <i>starting point properties</i> from PROV, in particular <a data-cite="PROV-O#wasAttributedTo"><code>prov:wasAttributedTo</code></a> (to link to an agent associated with the dataset production) and <a data-cite="PROV-O#wasDerivedFrom"><code>prov:wasDerivedFrom</code></a> (to link to a predecessor dataset). Both of these complement Dublin Core properties already used in DCAT, as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              <code>prov:wasAttributedTo</code> provides a general link to all kinds of associated agents, such as project sponsors, managers, dataset owners, etc which are not correctly characterized using <code>dcterms:creator</code>, <code>dcterms:contributor</code> or <code>dcterms:publisher</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
              <code>prov:wasDerivedFrom</code> supports a more specific relationship to an input or predecessor dataset compared with <code>dcterms:source</code>, which is not necessarily a previous dataset.
          </li>
      </ul>

  dcterms:title "Data from: GlobTherm, a global database on thermal tolerances for aquatic and terrestrial organisms"@en ;
  dcterms:description "How climate affects species distributions is a longstanding question receiving renewed interest owing to the need to predict the impacts of global warming on biodiversity. Is climate change forcing species to live near their critical thermal limits? Are these limits likely to change through natural selection? These and other important questions can be addressed with models relating geographical distributions of species with climate data, but inferences made with these models are highly contingent on non-climatic factors such as biotic interactions. Improved understanding of climate change effects on species will require extensive analysis of thermal physiological traits, but such data are scarce and scattered. To overcome current limitations, we created the GlobTherm database. The database contains experimentally derived species’ thermal tolerance data currently comprising over 2,000 species of terrestrial, freshwater, intertidal and marine multicellular algae, pl ants, fungi, and animals. The GlobTherm database will be maintained and curated by iDiv with the aim of expanding it, and enable further investigations on the effects of climate on the distribution of life on Earth."@en ;

<h2>Changes since the first public working draft of 17 December 2020</h2>

<p>The document has undergone the following changes since the DCAT 3 first public working draft of 17 December 2020 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-3-20201217]]:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="#basic-example"></a> has been extended to include titles, labels, and keywords in two different languages (English and Spanish) to illustrate the use of language tags.</p></li>
</ul>  
<ul>
  <li><p>The recommended range of property <a href="#Property:distribution_size"></a> has been changed from <a data-cite="XMLSCHEMA11-2#decimal"><code>xsd:decimal</code></a> to <a data-cite="XMLSCHEMA11-2#nonNegativeInteger"><code>xsd:nonNegativeInteger</code></a> </p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="#dataset-versions"></a> has been revised to focus specifically on versions derived from the revision of a resource, and by following the [[PAV]] approach for the specification of version chains and hierarchies - previous, next, current, last version. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>The introductory text has been revised according to the new scope.</li>
<li>The section on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/WD-vocab-dcat-3-20201217/#version-types">version types</a> (link to previous version) has been removed, and <a href="#version-relationships">a new section</a> has been added to describe how to specify relationships between versions.</li>
<li>Dropped support to the specification of backward (in)compatibility between versions by using properties <code>owl:backwardCompatibleWith</code> and <code>owl:incompatibleWith</code>, originally included in <a href="#version-info"></a>.</li>
<li><a href="#versioning-complementary-approaches">A new section</a> has been added at the end to compare the DCAT versioning approach with those used in OWL, [[?DCTERMS]], and [[?PROV-O]].</li>
</ul>
<p>The other sections include only editorial changes.</p>
</li>
<li><a href="#Class:Resource"></a> has been updated to include the definition of the properties illustrated in <a href="#dataset-versions"></a>.</li>
<li><p><a href="#dataset-series"></a> has been revised making dataset series first class citizens of data catalogs and introducing new properties for linking dataset series and datasets. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new class <code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code> has been defined (see <a href="#Class:Dataset_Series"></a>) - see Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/1272">#1272</a>.</li>
<li>Property <a href="#Property:dataset_in_series"><code>dcat:inSeries</code></a> has been added to <a href="#Class:Dataset"></a> - see Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/1307">#1307</a>.</li>
<li>Properties <a href="#Property:resource_first"><code>dcat:first</code></a>, <a href="#Property:resource_previous"><code>dcat:prev</code></a>, <code>dcat:next</code>, and <a href="#Property:resource_last"><code>dcat:last</code></a> have been added to <a href="#Class:Resource"></a> - see Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/1308">#1308</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added property <a href="#Property:distribution_checksum"><code>spdx:checksum</code></a> to <a href="#Class:Distribution"></a>; added class <code>spdx:Checksum</code> (see <a href="#Class:Checksum"></a>), and its properties <a href="#Property:checksum_algorithm"><code>spdx:algorithm</code></a> and <a href="#Property:checksum_checksum_value"><code>spdx:checksumValue</code></a> - see Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/1287">#1287</a>.</li>
<li>Revised range of property <a href="#Property:location_geometry"><code title="http://www.w3.org/ns/locn#geometry">locn:geometry</code></a>, to align it with its definition in [[LOCN]]. The usage note of this property has been also revised to make it clear that it can be used with either geometry literals or classes - see Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/1293">#1293</a>.</li>
<li>Added examples to <a href="#license-rights"></a> - see Issues <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/676">#676</a> and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/1333">#1333</a>.</li>
<li>Replaced [[?DCTERMS]] namespace prefix <code>dct:</code> with <code>dcterms:</code> throughout the document - see Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/1314">#1314</a>.</li>
<li>Fixed inconsistent use of "URI" and "IRI" throughout the document - see Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/1341">#1341</a>.</li>
<li>Removed NOTE in <a href="#ex-spatial-coverage-centroid"></a> showing an example of the use of [[?W3C-BASIC-GEO]] for the specification of point geometries - see Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/1347">#1347</a>.</li>
<li>Revised textual descriptions of classes and properties to clarify that the resources in a catalog are not limited to datasets and data services - see Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/1349">#1349</a>.</li>
<li>Fixed inconsistent use of property labels - see Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/1350">#1350</a>.</li>
<li>Updated definition for <code>dcat:catalog</code> - see Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/1156">#1156</a>.</li>

        <p>The document has undergone the following changes since the  DCAT 1 W3C Recommendation of 16 January 2014 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]]:</p>

        <ul>


<li>
A new property <a href="#Property:resource_is_referenced_by"><code>dcterms:isReferencedBy</code></a> was added to the class <a href="#Class:Resource"><code>dcat:Resource</code></a> to associate the resource described in the catalog with an external resource that references, cites, or points to the cataloged resource. In particular, in the case of datasets, this property supports the data citation use case where a publication references a dataset. For other types of relations not covered by this or other known properties, the specification provides the <a href="#qualified-forms">qualified relations</a> pattern.
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/63">#63</a>.
</li>

<li>
A new section <a href="#time-and-space"></a> was added to describe how to indicate the temporal and spatial characteristics of a resource. 
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/83">#83</a>, Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/84">#84</a>, Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/85">#85</a>.

A new class <a href="#Class:Period_of_Time"><code>dcterms:PeriodOftime</code></a> and four new properties (<a href="#Property:period_start_date"><code>dcat:startDate</code></a>, <a href="#Property:period_end_date"><code>dcat:endDate</code></a>, <a href="#Property:period_has_beginning"><code>time:hasBeginning</code></a>, <a href="#Property:period_has_end"><code>time:hasEnd</code></a>) added to support description of a temporal interval, to be used for specifying the temporal coverage of a resource. 
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/85">#85</a>.
</li>

<li>
The global range of the property <a href="#Property:catalog_themes"><code>dcat:themeTaxonomy</code></a> relaxed to allow linking to a taxonomy that is not formalized as a <code>skos:ConceptScheme</code>. 
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/119">#119</a>.
</li>

<li>
A new property <a href="#Property:dataset_spatial_resolution"><code>dcat:spatialResolutionInMeters</code></a> added to support description of the spatial resolution of datasets and distributions. 
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/84">#84</a>.
</li>

<li>
A new property <a href="#Property:dataset_temporal_resolution"><code>dcat:temporalResolution</code></a> added to support description of the temporal resolution of datasets and distributions. 
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/84">#84</a>.
</li>

<li>
Two new properties, <a href="#Property:distribution_packaging_format"><code>dcat:packageFormat</code></a> and <a href="#Property:distribution_compression_format"><code>dcat:compressFormat</code></a>, were added to specify packaged and compressed distributions, respectively. 
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/54">#54</a>.
</li>

<li>
A new section <a href="#qualified-relationship"></a>, a new property <a href="#Property:resource_qualified_relation"><code>dcat:qualifiedRelation</code></a> and a new class <a href="#Class:Relationship"><code>dcat:Relationship</code></a> added to support relationships between datasets or other resources. 
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/79">#79</a>.
</li>

<li>
A new  section <a href="#dereferenceable-identifiers"></a> was added to describe how to indicate different types of identifiers by using [[!DCTERMS]] and [[?VOCAB-ADMS]]. 
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/53">#53</a> and Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/68">#68</a>.
</li>

<li>
A new section <a href="#qualified-attribution"></a> was added to recommend a pattern for assigning an agent to a cataloged resource with a qualified relationship.
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/79">#79</a>.
</li>

<li>
<a href="#Property:relationship_hadRole">Property: had role</a>: 
The property <code>dcat:hadRole</code> is added to support the use of <a data-cite="?PROV-O#qualifiedAttribution"><code>prov:qualifiedAttribution</code></a> to associate an agent with a resource, where the role of the agent with relation to the resource is specified, and is something other than the standard [[DCTERMS]] roles: creator, publisher or contributor. 
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/79">#79</a>
</li>
<!--
<li>
The section <a href="#license-rights"></a> was added to describe patterns for linking <code>dcat:Dataset</code>s and <code>dcat:Distribution</code>s to the relevant license and rights expressions.
</li>
-->
<li>
<a href="#Property:resource_creator">Property: resource creator</a>: 
The property <code>dcterms:creator</code> is recommended for use in the context of a dataset or other resource to allow the entity responsible for generating the resource to be recorded. 
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/61">#61</a>
</li>

<li>
<a href="#Property:dataset_was_generated_by">Property: was generated by</a>: 
The property <code>prov:wasGeneratedBy</code> is recommended for use in the context of a dataset to allow the provenance or business context to be recorded. 
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/71">#71</a>
</li>

<li>
<a href="#Property:resource_relation">Property: resource relation</a>: 
The property <code>dcterms:relation</code> is recommended for use in the context of a cataloged resource to capture general relationships, including the case where the package of resources associated with a cataloged item includes a mixture of representations, parts, documentation and other elements which are not strictly 'distributions' of a dataset - see Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/253">#253</a>. 
The more general use of <code>dcterms:relation</code> is driven by the requirement documented in Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/81">#81</a>.
</li>

<li>
<a href="#Property:distribution_media_type">Property: media type</a>: 
The range of <code>dcat:mediaType</code> has been tightened from <code>dcterms:MediaTypeOrExtent</code> to <code>dcterms:MediaType</code>. 
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/127">#127</a>.
</li>

<li>
<a href="#Property:distribution_conforms_to">Property: conforms to</a>: 
The property <code>dcterms:conformsTo</code> is recommended for use in the context of a <code>dcat:Distribution</code> to allow the model or schema used for the representation to be indicated as well as the serialization (which is indicated using <code>dcterms:format</code> and <code>dcat:mediaType</code>). 
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/55">#55</a>.
</li>

<li>
Errors in examples of <a href="#Property:distribution_media_type"><code>dcat:mediaType</code></a> usage fixed. 
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/170">#170</a>.
</li>

<li>
A new section <a href="#quality-information"></a> was added to provide recommendations for how to associate quality information to datasets using elements from the W3C DQV vocabulary [[?VOCAB-DQV]]. Since [[?VOCAB-DQV]] is not a rec-track document, these are non-normative. 
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/57">#57</a> and Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/58">#58</a>.
</li>

<li>
<a href="#Class:Resource">Class: Cataloged resource</a>: 
In DCAT 1 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the scope of a <a href="#Class:Catalog"><code>dcat:Catalog</code></a> was limited to datasets. This has been generalized, and properties common to all cataloged resources are now associated with a super-class <a href="#Class:Resource"><code>dcat:Resource</code></a>.
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">#172</a> and Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/116">#116</a>. 
<!--
The wiki page on <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/wiki/Cataloguing-data-services">Cataloguing data services</a> describes some proposals related to this requirement.
-->
</li>

<li>
<a href="#Class:Data_Service">Class: Data service</a>: 
In DCAT 1 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the scope of a <a href="#Class:Catalog"><code>dcat:Catalog</code></a> was limited to datasets. The new class <code>dcat:DataService</code> has been added to support cataloging of various kinds of data services. 
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">#172</a>, Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/56">#56</a>, Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/432">#432</a>, Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/821">#821</a>.
</li>

<li><a href="#Class:Dataset">Class: Dataset</a>:
In DCAT 1 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] <a href="#Class:Dataset"><code>dcat:Dataset</code></a> was a sub-class of <a href="http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Dataset"><code>dctype:Dataset</code></a>, which is a term of the <a data-cite="?DCTERMS#section-7">DCMI Types vocabulary</a> [[!DCTERMS]]. This relationship has been removed in the revised DCAT vocabulary. 
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/98">#98</a>.
</li>

<li>
<a href="#Class:Distribution">Class: Distribution</a>: 
In DCAT 1 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the definition of a <a href="#Class:Distribution"><code>dcat:Distribution</code></a> allowed a number of alternative interpretations. The definition has been rephrased to clarify that distributions are primarily <i>representations</i> of datasets. 
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">#52</a> and related use cases.
</li>

<li><a href="#Property:resource_theme">Property: theme/category</a>:
In DCAT 1 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the domain of <code>dcat:theme</code> was <code>dcat:Dataset</code>, which limited use of this property in other contexts. The domain has been relaxed in DCAT 2. 
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/123">#123</a>.
</li>

<li><a href="#Property:resource_type">Property: type/genre</a>:
Added in DCAT revision. 
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/64">#64</a>, with examples of usage in overview section.
</li>

<li><a href="#Property:resource_keyword">Property: keyword/tag</a>:
In DCAT 1 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the domain of <code>dcat:keyword</code> was <code>dcat:Dataset</code>, which limited use of this property in other contexts. The domain has been relaxed in DCAT 2. 
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/121">#121</a>.
</li>

<li><a href="#Property:resource_contact_point">Property: contact point</a>:
In DCAT 1 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the domain of <code>dcat:contactPoint</code> was <code>dcat:Dataset</code>, which limited use of this property in other contexts. The domain has been relaxed in DCAT 2. 
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/95">#95</a>.
</li>

<li><a href="#Property:resource_landing_page">Property: landing page</a>:
In DCAT 1 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the domain of <code>dcat:landingPage</code> was <code>dcat:Dataset</code>, which limited use of this property in other contexts. The domain has been relaxed in DCAT 2. 
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/122">#122</a>.
</li>

<li><a href="http://vocab.org/vann/#usageNote">Property: <code>vann:usageNote</code></a>:
DCAT 1 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] included documentation captured as text using <a href="http://vocab.org/vann/#usageNote"><code>vann:usageNote</code></a> elements, which is a sub-property of <code>rdfs:seeAlso</code> - an <code>owl:ObjectProperty</code> that cannot have a Literal value. DCAT 2 has fixed these issues and replaced the use of <code>vann:usageNote</code> with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/#secdocumentation"><code>skos:scopeNote</code></a>. 
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/233">#233</a>.
</li>

<li><a href="#Property:record_conforms_to">Property: conforms to</a>:
DCAT 1 [[?VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] had no way of representing the conformance of a record metadata with a metadata standard. DCAT 2 has added the property <code>dcterms:conformsTo</code> for <code>dcat:CatalogRecord</code> to cover this requirement.
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/502">#502</a>.
</li>

<li>
Each relevant class section was extended with properties to deal with licensing, access rights, other rights and policies associated with the classes, as recommended in <a href="#license-rights"></a>.
</li>

<li>
A new section <a href="#license-rights"></a> was added to provide guidance and recommendations for the use of <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#http://purl.org/dc/terms/license"><code>dcterms:license</code></a>, <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#http://purl.org/dc/terms/accessRights"><code>dcterms:accessRights</code></a>, and <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#http://purl.org/dc/terms/rights"><code>dcterms:rights</code></a> in the context of dcat catalogs and distributions. 
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/114">#114</a> for the background discussion.
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="#Class:Catalog">Class: Catalog</a>:
This class has been made a sub-class of <code>dcat:Dataset</code>. Moreover, the following properties have been added: 
<a href="#Property:catalog_has_part"><code>dcterms:hasPart</code></a>, to specify a cataloged resource, irrespective of its type; 
<a href="#Property:catalog_service"><code>dcat:service</code></a>, to specify a cataloged data service; 
<a href="#Property:catalog_catalog"><code>dcat:catalog</code></a>, to specify sub-catalogs.
See Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">#172</a>.
