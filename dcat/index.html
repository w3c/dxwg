    <p>DCAT is an RDF vocabulary designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogs published on the Web. This document defines the schema and provides examples for its use.</p>
    <p>By using DCAT to describe datasets in data catalogs, publishers are using a standard model and vocabulary that facilitates the consumption and aggregation of metadata from multiple catalogs,
        and in doing so can increase the discoverability of datasets. It also makes it possible to have a decentralized approach to publishing data catalogs and makes federated search for datasets across catalogs in multiple sites possible using the same query mechanism and structure. Aggregated DCAT metadata can serve as a manifest file as part of the digital preservation process.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">The namespace for DCAT terms is <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#</code></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">The suggested prefix for the DCAT namespace is <code>dcat</code></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">The (revised) DCAT vocabulary is available <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/dxwg/gh-pages/dcat/rdf/dcat.ttl">here</a>.</p>

    <p>
        Since the <a href="">First Public Working Draft</a>, the main changes to the DCAT vocabulary have been:
    <ul>
        <li>addition of a <code><a href="#Class:Resource">dcat:Resource</a></code> class for representing any resource than can be included in the catalog, this is
            now the super-class of <code><a href="#Class:Dataset">dcat:Dataset</a></code></li>
        <li>addition of <code><a href="#Class:Data_Service">dcat:DataService</a></code>, as a sub-class of <code><a href="#Class:Resource">dcat:Resource</a></code>, to support cataloguing service end-points providing access to resources</li>
        <li>addition of <code><a href="#Class:Data_Distribution_Service">dcat:DataDistributionService</a></code>, as a sub-class of <code><a href="#Class:Data_Service">dcat:DataService</a></code>,
            representing service end-points providing access to datasets through their distributions, respectively </li>
        <li>addition of ways to representing <a href="#bag-of-files">loosely structured catalogs</a>, where there is no distinction between a dataset and its distributions</li>
        <li>more details for the ways of representing <a href="#examples-dataset-provenance">dataset provenance</a> and <a href="#quality-information">dataset quality</a></li>
        <li>an <a href="#dcat-sdo">alignment</a> between the DCAT vocabulary and the schema.org vocabulary</li>
    </ul>

    </p>

    <h3 id="dcat_history">DCAT history</h3>
    <p>The original DCAT vocabulary (originally hosted at http://vocab.deri.ie/dcat) was developed at the Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI), refined by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/egov/">eGov Interest Group</a>, and then finally standardized in 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/gld/">Government Linked Data (GLD)</a> Working Group.</p>
    <p>This revised version of DCAT was developed by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/">Dataset Exchange Working Group</a> in response to a new set of Use Cases and Requirements [[DCAT-UCR]] submitted on the basis of experience with the DCAT vocabulary from the time of the original version, and new applications not originally considered. A summary of the changes from  [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] can be found at <a href="#changes">Change History</a></p>

    <h3 id="external_terms">External terms</h3>
    <p>DCAT incorporates terms from pre-existing vocabularies where stable terms with appropriate meanings could be found, such as foaf:homepage and dct:title.  Informal summary definitions of the externally-defined terms are included here for convenience, while authoritative definitions are available in the normative references.  Changes to definitions in the references, if any, supersede the summaries given in this specification.  Note that conformance to DCAT (Section 4) concerns usage of only the terms in the DCAT namespace itself, so possible changes to the external definitions will not affect the conformance of DCAT implementations.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p class="note">From DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]]</p>

    <p>Data can come in many formats, ranging from spreadsheets, through XML and RDF, to various specialty formats. DCAT does not make any assumptions about the serialization format of the datasets described in a catalog. Other, complementary vocabularies <em title="MAY" class="rfc2119">MAY</em> be used together with DCAT to provide more detailed format-specific information. For example, properties from the VoID vocabulary [[VOID]] can be used to express various statistics about a DCAT-described dataset if that dataset is in RDF format.</p>
    <p>This document does not prescribe any particular method of deploying data expressed in DCAT. DCAT is applicable in many contexts including RDF accessible via SPARQL endpoints, embedded in HTML pages as RDFa, or serialized as e.g. RDF/XML or Turtle. The examples in this document use Turtle simply because of Turtle's readability.</p>
</section>

<section id="motivation" class="informative"><h2>Motivation for change</h2>
    <p>The original Recommendation [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]], published in January 2014, provided the basic framework for describing datasets. Importantly, it made the distinction between a dataset as an abstract idea and a distribution as a manifestation of the dataset. Although DCAT has been widely adopted, it has become clear that the original specification lacked a number of essential features that were added either through application profiles, such as the European Commission's DCAT-AP [[DCAT-AP]], or the development of larger vocabularies that, to a greater or lesser extent, built upon the base standard, such as the Healthcare and Life Sciences Community Profile [[HCLS-Dataset]], the Data Tag Suite [[DATS]] and more. This version of DCAT has been developed to address the specific shortcomings that have come to light through the experiences of different communities, the aim being, of course, to improve interoperability between the outputs of these larger vocabularies.</p>
    <p>This draft includes re-writing of the specification throughout. Significant changes from the 2014 Recommendation are marked within the text using "Note" sections, as well as being described in the <a href="#changes">Change History</a>.</p>

<section id="namespaces-1">

    <h2 >Namespaces</h2>

    <p>The namespace for DCAT is <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#</code>.
        However, note that DCAT makes extensive use of terms from other vocabularies, in particular Dublin Core [[DCTERMS]].
        DCAT defines a minimal set of classes and properties of its own.

    <h2>Vocabulary overview</h2>

<!--
    <p class="note">Significantly extended from DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]]</p>
-->
<section id="dcat-scope">
    <h3>DCAT scope</h3>

    <p>DCAT is an RDF vocabulary for representing data catalogs.
      DCAT is based around eight main classes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
          <code><a href="#Class:Catalog">dcat:Catalog</a></code> represents a catalog, which is a dataset in which each individual item is a metadata record describing some resource; the scope of dcat:catalog is collections of metadata about <b>datasets</b> or <b>data services</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code><a href="#Class:Resource">dcat:Resource</a></code> represents an individual item description in a catalog.
          This class is not intended to be used directly, but is the parent class of <code><a href="#Class:Dataset">dcat:Dataset</a></code>, <code><a href="#Class:Data_Service">dcat:DataService</a></code> and <code><a href="#Class:Catalog">dcat:Catalog</a></code>.
          Member items in a catalog should be members of one of the sub-classes, or of a sub-class of these, or of a sub-class of <code><a href="#Class:Resource">dcat:Resource</a></code> defined in a DCAT application profile or other DCAT application.
          <code><a href="#Class:Resource">dcat:Resource</a></code> is effectively an extension point for defining a catalog of any kind of resource.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code><a href="#Class:Dataset">dcat:Dataset</a></code> represents a description of a dataset in a catalog.
          A dataset is a collection of data, published or curated by a single agent.
          Data comes in many forms, including numbers, words, pixels, imagery, sound and other multi-media, and potentially other types, any of which may be collected into a dataset.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code><a href="#Class:Distribution">dcat:Distribution</a></code> represents an accessible form or representation of a dataset, for example a downloadable file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code><a href="#Class:Data_Service">dcat:DataService</a></code> represents a description of a data service in a catalog.
          A data service is a collection of operations, accessible through an interface (API) that provide access to one or more datasets or data processing functions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code><a href="#Class:Data_Distribution_Service">dcat:DataDistributionService</a></code> represents a description of a data service that provides access to distributions of one or more datasets or extracts of datasets.
        </li>
        <!--
          <li>
            <code><a href="#Class:DataTransformationService">dcat:DataTransformationService</a></code> represents a service that can transform a dataset, e.g. spatial coordinate transformation; interpolation or resampling of a dataset.
          </li>
        -->
        <li>
          <code><a href="#Class:Discovery_Service">dcat:DiscoveryService</a></code> represents a description of a data service that provides access to one or more catalogs to support discovery functions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code><a href="#Class:Catalog_Record">dcat:CatalogRecord</a></code> represents a metadata item in the catalog, primarily concerning the registration information, such as who added the item and when.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">
        Along with the rest of the <a href="#vocabulary-overview">Vocabulary overview</a>, this diagram is <b>non-normative</b>.
        Furthermore, while the diagram uses UML-style class notation, it should be interpreted following the usual RDF open-world assumptions around the presence/absence of properties, relationships, and their cardinality.
        The properties shown in each class reflect those recommended in the descriptions of classes in the <a href="#vocabulary-specification">Vocabulary specification</a>.
        To assist in understanding the full scope of each class, properties are copied down from each '::super-class'.
        Cardinalities are shown in a few places to reinforce expectations, but these are not axiomatized or enforced in any way by this recommendation.
    </p>

    <p>
        A <b>dataset</b> in DCAT is defined as a "collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more serializations or formats".
        A dataset is a conceptual entity, and can be represented by one or more <b>distributions</b> that serialize the dataset for transfer.
        Distributions of a dataset can be provided via <b>data distribution services</b>.
        Detailed properties for a data distribution service API are out of the scope of this version of DCAT.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <b>data service</b> in DCAT is a collection of operations or API which provides access to data.
      A data service usually provides selection, extraction, combination, processing or transformation operations over datasets that might be hosted locally or remote to the service.
      The result of a request to a data service is a representation of a dataset. A <b>data distribution service</b> is a kind of service that provides the means to select and download a distribution of a dataset or subset.
      A <b>data discovery service</b> is a kind of service that provides the means to find the description of a suitable dataset, often through a portal or catalog service.
      Other kinds of data service might include <b>data transformation services</b> such as coordinate transformation services, re-sampling and interpolation services, and various <b>data processing services</b>.
      A data service might be tied to specific datasets, or its source data might be configured at request- or run-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Datasets and data services can be included in a <b>catalog</b>.
      A catalog is a kind of dataset whose member items are themselves the descriptions of datasets.
      Other types of thing might also be catalogued, but the scope of DCAT is currently limited to datasets and data services.
      To extend the scope of a catalog beyond datasets and data services it is recommended to define additional sub-classes of <code><a href="#Class:Resource">dcat:Resource</a></code> in a DCAT application profile or other DCAT application.
    </p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>
        The scope of DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] was limited to catalogs of datasets.
        A number of use cases for the revision involve <b>data distribution services</b> as members of a catalog - see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#ID6">DCAT Distribution to describe web services - ID6</a> and
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#ID18">Modeling service-based data access - ID18</a>.
        Hence, the scope of this revision of DCAT includes both datasets and data services, with an explicit class for Data Distribution Services, to enable these to be part of a DCAT conformant catalog.
        Provision for other data services to also be part of a Catalog is also made, as well as for Catalogs to be composed of other Catalogs.
        See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">Issue #172</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Catalogs of other kinds of things might be designed following the DCAT pattern, e.g. dealing with facilities, instruments, samples and specimens, other physical artefacts, events or activities.
        These are currently out of scope for DCAT, but might be defined through further sub-classes of <code><a href="#Class:Resource">dcat:Resource</a></code>, which could be specified in a DCAT application profile or other DCAT application.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>A <b>CatalogRecord</b> describes an entry in the catalog. Notice that while <code><a href="#Class:Resource">dcat:Resource</a></code> represents the dataset or service itself, <code><a href="#Class:Catalog_Record">dcat:CatalogRecord</a></code> is the record that describes the registration of an item in the catalog. The use of explicit <code><a href="#Class:Catalog_Record">dcat:CatalogRecord</a></code> is considered optional. It is used to capture provenance information about entries in a catalog explicitly. If this is not necessary then <code><a href="#Class:Catalog_Record">dcat:CatalogRecord</a></code> can be safely ignored.</p>

  <section id="dcat-rdf">
    <h3>RDF considerations</h3>
      <p id="owl2">
        The DCAT vocabulary is an OWL2 ontology [[OWL2-OVERVIEW]] formalized using [[RDF-SCHEMA]].
        Each class and property in DCAT is denoted by an [[IRI]].
        Locally defined elements are in the namespace <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#">http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#</a>.
        Elements are also adopted from several external vocabularies, in particular [[FOAF]], [[DCTERMS]] and [[PROV-O]]
      </p>
      <p id="blankNodes">
        RDF allows resources to have global identifiers (IRIs) or to be blank nodes.
        Blank nodes can be used to denote resources without explicitly naming them with an IRI.
        They can appear in the subject and object position of a triple [[RDF11-PRIMER]].
        For example, in many actual DCAT catalogs, distributions are represented as blank nodes nested inside the related dataset description.
        While blank nodes may offer flexibility for some use cases, in a Linked Data context, blank nodes limit our ability to collaboratively annotate data.
        A  blank node resource cannot be the target of a link and it can't be annotated with new information from new sources.
        As one of the biggest benefits of the Linked Data approach is that "anyone can say anything anywhere", use of blank nodes undermines some of the advantages we can gain from wide adoption of the RDF model.
        Even within the closed world of a single application dataset, use of blank nodes can quickly become limiting when integrating new data [[LinkedDataPatterns]].
        For these reasons, it is recommended that instances of the DCAT main classes have a global identifier, and use of blank nodes is generally discouraged when encoding DCAT in RDF.

        <h3>Basic Example</h3>
        <p>This example provides a quick overview of how DCAT might be used to represent a government catalog and its datasets. </p>

        <p>First, the catalog description:
        </p>
        <div class="example">
  <pre class="nohighlight turtle" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
:catalog
  a dcat:Catalog&nbsp;;
  dct:title "Imaginary Catalog"&nbsp;;

  dct:language &lt;http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-1/en&gt; &nbsp;;
  dcat:dataset&nbsp;:dataset-001&nbsp; , :dataset-002 , :dataset-003 ;
  .
</pre></div>
        <p>The publisher of the catalog has the relative URI&nbsp;:transparency-office. Further description of the publisher can be provided as in the following example:
        </p>
        <div class="example">
  <pre class="nohighlight turtle" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
:transparency-office
  a foaf:Organization&nbsp;;
  rdfs:label "Transparency Office"&nbsp;;
  .
</pre></div>
        <p>The catalog lists each of its datasets via the dcat:dataset property. In the example above, an example dataset was mentioned with the relative URI&nbsp;:dataset-001. A possible description of it using DCAT is shown below:
        </p>
        <div class="example">
  <pre class="nohighlight turtle" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">

        <p>In order to express the frequency of update in the example above, we chose to use an instance from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/#dsd-cog">Content-Oriented Guidelines</a> developed as part
            of the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Data Cube Vocabulary [[VOCAB-DATA-CUBE]] efforts. Additionally, we chose to describe the spatial and temporal coverage of the example dataset using URIs from <a href="http://www.geonames.org/">Geonames</a> and the Interval dataset (originally available from http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/interval) from data.gov.uk, respectively. A contact point is also provided where comments and feedback about the dataset can be sent. Further details about the contact point, such as email address or telephone number, can be provided using vCard [[VCARD-RDF]].</p>

        <p>The dataset distribution :dataset-001-csv can be downloaded as a 5Kb CSV file. This information is
            represented via an RDF resource of type dcat:Distribution.

        <p>Notice that this dataset is classified under the domain represented by the relative URI&nbsp;:accountability.

        <h3>Classifying dataset types</h3>

        <p>
            The type or genre of a dataset can be indicated using the <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/type">dct:type</a> property.
            It is recommended that the value of the property is be taken from a well governed and broadly recognised set of resource types,
            such as the <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#section-7">DCMI Type Vocabulary</a>,
            the <a href="https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/marcgt.html">MARC Genre/Terms Scheme</a>,
            the <a href="https://geo-ide.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php?title=ISO_19115_and_19115-2_CodeList_Dictionaries#MD_ScopeCode">ISO 19115 MD_Scope codes</a>,
            the <a href="https://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-4.1/include/datacite-resourceType-v4.1.xsd">DataCite resource types</a>,
            or the PARSE.Insight content-types from Re3data [[RE3DATA-SCHEMA]].
        </p>
        <p>
            In the following examples, a (notional) dataset is classified separately using values from different vocabularies.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
  <pre class="nohighlight turtle" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">

            while &nbsp;:dataset-001 was issued on 2011-12-05, its description on Imaginary Catalog was added on 2011-12-11. This can be represented by DCAT as in the following:

        <h3>RDF representation</h3>

        <p class="note">
            The DCAT RDF representation is modularized into several files or graphs to help users access a version of DCAT with only the alignments that they need.
            This mechanism can also be used to capture different levels of axiomatization, though the status of such proposals has not been finalized.
            See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/134">Issue #134</a> and the issues enumerated below.

            <p>
                Guidance on the use DCAT in a weakly-axiomatized environment, such as schema.org, has been identified as a requirement to be satisfied in this revision of DCAT.
            </p>
            <p>
                An <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/dxwg/gh-pages/dcat/rdf/dcat-schema.ttl">RDF graph containing a proposed alignment of DCAT with schema.org</a> is available. Comments on this alignment are invited.

            The use of guarded constraints (existence, cardinality, range-type) to control the use of the recommended properties in the context of a class is being considered as part of the revision of DCAT.
        </p>

        <p class="issue" data-number="110">
            The axiomatization of DCAT 2014 used global domain and range constraints for many of the properties defined in the DCAT namespace [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]]. This makes quite strong ontological commitments, some of which are now being reconsidered - see individual issues noted inline below.
        </p>

        <p>The (revised) DCAT vocabulary is <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/tree/gh-pages/dcat/rdf/">available in RDF</a>.
            The primary artefact <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/dxwg/gh-pages/dcat/rdf/dcat.ttl">dcat.ttl</a> is a serialization of the core DCAT vocabulary.
            Alongside it are a set of other RDF files that provide additional information, including:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                alignments to other vocabularies, some of which are normative and some of which are only for guidance
            </li>
            <li>
                additional axioms, which can be useful in some contexts
            </li>
            <li>
                some profiles of DCAT, including a profile that corresponds to the 2014 version of DCAT [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]]

                <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/relation">dct:relation</a> is a super-property of a number of more specific properties which express more precise relationships, so use of dct:relation is not inconsistent with a subsequent reclassification with more specific semantics, though the more specialized sub-properties <em title="SHOULD" class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> be used to link a dataset to component and supplementary resources if possible.

            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#RDSC">Dataset citation</a> is one of the requirements identified for the DCAT revision.
            Data citation is the practice of referencing data in a similar way as when providing bibliographic references, acknowledging data
            as a first class output in any investigative process. Data citation offers multiple benefits, such as crediting those producing the data,
            facilitating data discovery, supporting tracking the impact and reuse of data.

            To support data citation, the dataset description should include at a minimum: the dataset identifier, the dataset creator (added in this DCAT revision
            as part of the properties recommended for Dataset), the dataset title, the dataset publisher and the dataset release date.

            The constraints on the availability of such properties in the dataset description can be represented as a DCAT data citation profile.

<section id="Dereferenceable-identifiers" class="informative">
    <h2>Dereferenceable identifiers</h2>

    <p>DCAT should rely on persistent HTTP URIs, which are an effective way of making identifiers actionable.</p>
    <p>The property <a href="#Property:resource_identifier">dct:identifier</a>  explicitly indicates HTTP URIs as well as legacy identifiers. In the following examples,  <a href="#Property:resource_identifier">dct:identifier</a>  identifies a dataset, but it can similarly be used with any kind of resources.</p>

    <div class="example">
    <pre class="nohighlight turtle" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
&lt;https://example.org/id&gt; a dcat:Dataset;
	dct:identifier "https://example.org/id"^^xsd:anyURI
  . </pre></div>

    <p> Proxy dereferenceable URIs can be used  when resources haven't  HTTP dereferenceable IDs. For example, in the following, https://example.org/proxyid is a proxy for "id".</p>

    <div class="example">
    <pre class="nohighlight turtle" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
&lt;https://example.org/proxyid&gt; a dcat:Dataset;
	dct:identifier  "id"^^xsd:string
    .</pre></div>
    <p> The property <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-adms/#adms-identifier">adms:identifier</a> can express other locally minted identifiers or external identifiers, like Datacite, DOI, ELI etc., as long as they are globally unique and stable.</p>
    <p>The following example uses <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/adms#schemaAgency">adms:schemaAgency</a> and <a href="http://dublincore.org/2012/06/14/dcterms#creator">dct:creator</a> to represent the authority that defines the identifier scheme (e.g., DOI foundation in the example), adms:schemaAgency is used when the authority has no URI associated.
    </p>

    <div class="example">
    <pre class="nohighlight turtle" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
&lt;https://example.org/id&gt; a dcat:Dataset;
    adms:identifier  &lt;https://example.org/iddoi&gt; .
	.

&lt;https://example.org/iddoi&gt; rdf:type adms:Identifier ;
   skos:notation "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1486279"^^xsd:anyURI;
   # reading https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#notations more than one skos:notation can be set
   skos:notation "info:doi/10.5281/zenodo.1486279"^^xsd:anyURI  ;
   # the authority/agency defining the identifier scheme, used if the agency has no URI
   adms:schemaAgency "International DOI Foundation" ;
   # the authority/agency defining the identifier scheme, used if the agency has URI
   dct:creator  ex:InternationalDOIFundation.

ex:InternationalDOIFundation a dct:Agent;
    rdfs:label "International DOI Foundation";
    foaf:homepage &lt;https://www.doi.org/&gt; .
    </pre>
    </div>

    <p> The example does not represent the authority responsible for assigning and maintaining identifiers using that scheme (e.g., zenodo) as naming the registrant goes against the philosophy of DOI where the sub-spaces are abstracted from the organisation that registers them, with the advantage that DOIs don't change when the organisation changes or the responsibility for that sub-space is handed over to someone else.</p>

    <p>When the HTTP dereferenceable ID returns RDF/OWL description for the dataset, the use owl:sameAs might be consider. For example, </p>
    <div class="example">
    <pre class="nohighlight turtle" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
&lt;https://example.org/id&gt; a dcat:Dataset;
	...
	owl:sameAs &lt;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1486279&gt; .
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>when dereferenced with media type "text/turtle",  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1486279 returns a schema.org description for the dataset, which might dinamically enrich the description provided by https://example.org/id. </p>


    <p>Identifiers for datasets should follow the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#DataIdentifiers">DWBP Data Identifier Best Practices</a>.</p>

     <p class="issue" data-number="67">
                The need to distinguish between primary and alternative (legacy) identifiers for a dataset has been posed as a requirement. However, it is very much application-specific and should be better addressed in application profiles rather than being mandate a general approach.
            </p>

    <p>Depending on the application context, specific guidelines such as <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/release/dcat-ap-how-manage-duplicates">"DCAT-AP: How to manage duplicates?"</a> can be adopted for distinguishing authoritative datasets from dataset harvested by third parties catalogs.</p>

    <section id="identifiers-type">
    <h2>Indicating common identifier types</h2>

        <p> If identifiers are not HTTP dereferenceable, common identifier types can be served as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-recognized-datatype-iris">RDF datatypes</a> or custom <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/#Datatype_Definitions">OWL datatypes</a> for the sake of interoperability, see 'ex:type' in the following</p>

        <div class="example">
            <pre class="nohighlight turtle" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
&lt;https://example.org/id&gt; a dcat:Dataset;
	...
	adms:identifier &lt;https://example.org/sid&gt; .

 &lt;https://example.org/sid&gt; rdf:type adms:Identifier ;
 # the actual id
	 skos:notation "PA 1-060-815"^^ex:type ;
 # Human readable schema agency
	 adms:schemaAgency "US Copyright Office" ;
	 dcterms:issued "2001-09-12"^^xsd:date .
            </pre>
        </div>

        <p>If a registered URI type is used (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.1">following RFC-3986</a>), the identifier scheme is part of the URI; thus indicating a separate identifier scheme in 'type' is redundant. For example, DOI is registered as a namespace in the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml">'info' URI scheme</a> (see <a href="https://www.doi.org/faq.html">faq #11</a>), so according to RFC-3986 URI it should be encoded as in the following</p>

        <div class="example">
            <pre class="nohighlight turtle" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">&lt;https://example.org/sid&gt; rdf:type adms:Identifier ;
 # the actual id
	 skos:notation "info:doi/10.1109/5.771073"^^xsd:anyURI
 .
            </pre>
        </div>

        <p>Otherwise, examples of common types for identifier scheme (arXiv, etc) are defined in <a href="https://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-4.1/include/datacite-relatedIdentifierType-v4.xsd">DataCite schema</a> and <a href="https://fairsharing.org/standards/?q=&selected_facets=type_exact:identifier%20schema">FAIRsharing Registry</a>.</p>

<section id="quality-information" class="informative">
    <h2>Quality information</h2>
    <div class="note"><p>This section is not-normative as it provides guidance on how to document the quality of DCAT first class entities (e.g., datasets, distributions) and it does not define new DCAT terms. The guidance relies on the Data Quality Vocabulary(DQV) [[VOCAB-DQV]], which is a W3C Group Note.</p></div>

    The Data Quality Vocabulary (DQV) offers common modelling patterns for different aspects of Data Quality.

    It can relate  DCAT datasets and distributions with different types of quality information including
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dqv/#dqv:QualityAnnotation"> dqv:QualityAnnotation</a>, which represents feedback and quality certificates given about the dataset or its distribution. </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dqv/#dqv:QualityPolicy">dqv:QualityPolicy</a>, which represents a policy or agreement that is chiefly governed by data quality concerns.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dqv/#dqv:QualityMeasurement">dqv:QualityMeasurement</a>, which represents a metric value providing quantitative or qualitative information about the dataset or distribution.</li>
    </ul>

    Each type of quality information can pertain to one or more quality dimensions, namely, quality characteristics relevant to the consumer. The practice to see the quality as a multi-dimensional space is consolidated in the field of quality management to split the quality management into addressable chunks. DQV does not define a normative list of quality dimensions. It offers the quality dimensions proposed in ISO/IEC 25012 [[ISOIEC25012]] and Zaveri et al. [[ZaveriEtAl]] as two possible starting points. It also provides an <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ldqd">RDF representation</a> for the quality dimensions and categories defined in the latter. Ultimately, implementers will need to choose themselves the collection of quality dimensions that best fits their needs.

    The following section shows how DCAT and DQV can be coupled to describe the quality of datasets and distributions.
    For a comprehensive introduction  and further examples of use, please refer to the Data Quality Vocabulary (DQV) group note [[VOCAB-DQV]].
    <div class="note">
        <p>The following examples make no comments on where the quality information would reside and how it is managed. That is out of scope for the DCAT vocabulary.  The assumption made is that the quality individuals are available using the URIs indicated.
            Besides, the examples and more in general the DQV  is neutral to the data portal design choices on how to collect quality information. For example, data portals can collect DQV instances by implementing specific UI to annotate data or by taking inputs from 3rd-party services.

            <h3> Degree of conformance</h3>
            <p>Some legal context requires to specify the degree of conformance. For example,  INSPIRE metadata adopts a specific <a href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/DegreeOfConformity">controlled vocabulary</a> to express  non-conformance and non-evaluation beside the full compliance. As suggested in [[GeoDCAT-AP]], the following example specifies the degree of conformance (i.e.,  not conformant) by declaring the  <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-type">dct:type</a> for the result of conformance test.  [[GeoDCAT-AP]] suggests to use a PROV entity to model the  conformance test (e.g., a:TestResult),  a PROV activity to model the testing activity (e,g., a:TestingActivity), a PROV plan derived by the INSPIRE Directive to represent  conformance test (e.g., a:ConformanceTest). A qualified PROV association binds the testing activity to the conformance test.

  <h2>Attribution roles</h2>
  <p>
    The standard Dublin Core properties <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/contributor">dct:contributor</a>, <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator">dct:creator</a> and <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/publisher">dct:publisher</a>, and the generic <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#wasAttributedTo">prov:wasAttributedTo</a> from [[PROV-O]], support basic associations of responsible agents with a catalogued resource.
    However, there are many other roles of importance in relation to datasets and services - e.g. funder, distributor, custodian, editor.
    Some of these roles are enumerated in the CI_RoleCode values from [[ISO-19115-1]], in the [[DataCite]] metadata schema, and included within the <a href="https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators">MARC relators</a>.
  <p>
  </p>
    A general method for assigning an agent to a resource with a specified relationship is provided by using the qualified form <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#qualifiedAttribution">prov:qualifiedAttribution</a> from [[PROV-O]].
    The following provides an illustration:
  </p>
<div class="example">

<p>
  In this example the roles are taken from [[ISO-19115-1]] which are available as linked data in a <a href="http://registry.it.csiro.au/def/isotc211/CI_RoleCode">discrete list</a>.

    support the description of relationships between datasets and other catalogued resources.
    However, there are many other relationships of importance - e.g. alternate, canonical, original, preview, stereo-mate, working-copy-of.
    Some of these roles are enumerated in the DS_AssociationTypeCode values from [[ISO-19115-1]], the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations">IANA Registry of Link Relations</a>, in the [[DataCite]] metadata schema, and included within the <a href="https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators">MARC relators</a>.

    <h2>Provenance patterns</h2>
    <p class="issue" data-number="128">
        A number of requirements identify the need to provide better support for Dataset and Record provenance - see

        <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/77">Issue #77</a>,

        It has been suggested that many of the requirements can be satisfied by using capabilities from the [[PROV-O]] ontology,
        in particular by treating <code><a href="#Class:Resource">dcat:Resource</a></code> and/or <code><a href="#Class:Catalog_Record">dcat:CatalogRecord</a></code> a sub-class of <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#Entity">prov:Entity</a>.

<section id="license-rights">

    <h2>License and rights statements</h2>

	<p class="note">
		DCAT 2014 handling of license and rights do not appear to satisfy all requirements [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]].
		The recently completed W3C ODRL vocabulary [[ODRL-VOCAB]] provides a rich language for describing many kinds of rights and obligations.
		In this chapter, we describe some patterns for linking DCAT Datasets and/or Distributions to suitable license and rights expressions.
	</p>

	<p>
		Selecting the right way to express conditions for access to and re-use of resources can be complex.
		Implementers should always seek legal advice before deciding which conditions apply to the resource being described.
	</p>
<!--
	<div class="ednote" title="Original text">

	<p>
		This specification distinguishes three main situations: one where a statement is associated with the resource that is explicitly declared as a 'license';
		a second where the statement is not explicitly declared as a 'license'; and a third where the conditions are explicitly expressed as an ODRL Policy.
	</p>
	<p>
		The following approach is recommended:
		<ol>
			<li>use <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-license">dct:license</a> to refer to well-known licenses such as <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/">those defined by Creative Commons</a></br>
			The object of dct:license, a <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-LicenseDocument">dct:LicenseDocument</a>, is "A legal document giving official permission to do something with a Resource."</li>
			<li>use <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-rights">dct:rights</a> to refer to rights statements that are not licenses, such as copyright statements</br>
			The object of dct:rights, a <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-RightsStatement">dct:RightsStatement</a>, is "A statement about the intellectual property rights (IPR) held in or over a Resource, a legal document giving official permission to do something with a resource, or a statement about access rights."
			This is more general than a <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-LicenseDocument">dct:LicenseDocument</a> and therefore should be used if it the statement contains more general information about rights.</li>
			<li>use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#term-hasPolicy">odrl:hasPolicy</a> for linking to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#term-Policy">ODRL policies</a></br>
			The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) is a policy expression language that provides a flexible and interoperable information model, vocabulary, and encoding mechanisms for representing statements about usage (i.e. permissions, prohibitions, and obligations) of content and services.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>

	</div>
-->
	<p>
    This specification distinguishes three main situations:
    one where a statement is associated with a resource that is explicitly declared as a 'license';
    a second, where the statement is associated with a resource denoting only access rights;
    a third, covering all the other cases - i.e., statements not concerning licensing conditions and/or access rights (e.g., copyright statements).
	</p>

	<p class="note">
	  It is worth noting that the provision of licensing conditions and access rights complies with the [[DWBP]]'s Best Practices 4 ("<a data-cite="DWBP#licenses">Provide data license information</a>") and 22 ("<a data-cite="DWBP#DataUnavailabilityReference">Provide an explanation for data that is not available</a>"), respectively.
	</p>

	<p>
		To address these scenarios, the recommendation is to use property dct:rights, and its sub-properties dct:license and dct:accessRights. More precisely:
  </p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			  <p>use <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-license">dct:license</a> to refer to licenses;</p>
<!--
			<p>The object of dct:license, a <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-LicenseDocument">dct:LicenseDocument</a>, is "A legal document giving official permission to do something with a Resource."</p>
-->
        <p class="note">
          For interoperability, it is recommended to use canonical URIs of well-known licenses such as <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/">those defined by Creative Commons</a>.
        </p>
			</li>
			<li>
			  <p>use <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-accessRights">dct:accessRights</a>  to express statements concerning only access rights (e.g., whether data can be accessed by anyone or just by authorized parties);</p>
<!--
        <p>The object of dct:accessRights is a dct:RightsStatement providing "Information about who can access the resource or an indication of its security status."</p>
-->
        <p class="note">
          Access rights can also be expressed as code lists / taxonomies. Examples include the access rights code list  [[MDR-AR]] used in [[DCAT-AP]] and the <a href="http://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/">Eprints Access Rights Vocabulary Encoding Scheme</a>.
        </p>
      </li>
			<li>
			  <p>use <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-rights">dct:rights</a> for all the other types of rights statements - those which are not covered by dct:license and dct:accessRights, such as copyright statementss.</p>
<!--
			  <p>The object of dct:rights, a <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-RightsStatement">dct:RightsStatement</a>, is "A statement about the intellectual property rights (IPR) held in or over a Resource, a legal document giving official permission to do something with a resource, or a statement about access rights."
			This is more general than a <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-LicenseDocument">dct:LicenseDocument</a> and therefore should be used if it the statement contains more general information about rights.</p>
-->
			  <p class="note">
			    A more sophisticated approach to express rights, based on and extending [[DCTERMS]], is provided by the Open Data Rights Statement Vocabulary (ODRS) [[ODRS]], which defines properties for specifying, among others, copyright statements and copyright notices.
			  </p>
			</li>
		</ol>

	<p>Finally, in the particular case when rights are expressed via <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#term-Policy">ODRL policies</a>, it is recommended to use use the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#term-hasPolicy">odrl:hasPolicy</a> property as the link from the description of the catalogued resource or distribution to the ODRL policy, in addition to the relevant <code>dct</code> property.</p>
  <p class="note">The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) [[ODRL-VOCAB]] is a policy expression language that provides a flexible and interoperable information model, vocabulary, and encoding mechanisms for representing statements about usage (i.e. permissions, prohibitions, and obligations) of content and services.</p>

  <p>Recommendations on the use of these properties on the different types of resources defined in DCAT are provided in the relevant class descriptions.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>
            General purpose web search services that use metadata at all rely primarily on [[SCHEMA-ORG]], so the relationship of DCAT to [[SCHEMA-ORG]] is of interest for data providers
            who wish their datasets and services to be exposed through those indexes.
        </p>
        <p>
            A <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/Datasets">mapping between DCAT 2014 and schema.org</a> was discussed on the original proposal to extend [[SCHEMA-ORG]] for describing datasets and data catalogs.
            Partial mappings between DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] and [[SCHEMA-ORG]] were provided earlier by the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/wiki/ISO_19115_-_DCAT_-_Schema.org_mapping">Spatial Data on the Web Working Group</a>, building upon previous work.
        </p>
        <p>
            A recommended mapping from the revised DCAT (this document) to [[SCHEMA-ORG]] is <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/dxwg/gh-pages/dcat/rdf/dcat-schema.ttl">available in an RDF file</a>.
            This mapping is axiomatized using the predicates <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code>, <code>rdfs:subPropertyOf</code>, <code>owl:equivalentClass</code>, <code>owl:equivalentProperty</code>, <code>skos:closeMatch</code>,
            and also using the annotation properties <code>schema:domainIncludes</code> and <code>schema:rangeIncludes</code> to match [[SCHEMA-ORG]] semantics. The mapping is summarized in the table below, considering the prefix <code>schema</code> as <code>http://schema.org/</code>.
        </p>
        <p class="issue" data-number="251">
            This alignment of DCAT with schema.org is provisional and non-normative. Feedback is invited in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/251">issue tracker</a>.

        <h3>Linked Data Platform (LDP)</h3>

        <p>
            DCAT provides a data model for representation of metadata about datasets in the form of Linked Data, but it does not specify how this metadata can be accessed or modified.
            The DCAT compatible metadata can be viewed as collections of Catalog Records, Datasets and Data Services contained in a Catalog, and a collection of Distributions contained in a Dataset.
            The Linked Data Platform [[LDP]] specification deals with access to and modification of Linked Data Platform Containers (LDPCs).
            This section provides guidance on how to represent DCAT metadata as LDP Containers, which supports namely the implementation of <a href="https://solid.mit.edu/" title="Solid">Solid</a> based DCAT catalogs.
        </p>

        <p>
            First, we will present an example of a LDPC for datasets in a catalog.
            There is one catalog with one dataset.
            The dataset is contained in the <code>&lt;/datasets/&gt;</code> LDP Direct Container.
            To ensure the LDPC discovery, we connect it to the Catalog using the <code>dcat:datasets</code> predicate.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
            <div class="example-title marker">
                <span>Example 1</span>
            </div>
            <pre class="nohighlight turtle" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
@prefix dcat: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#&gt; .
@prefix ldp:  &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#&gt; .

@base &lt;https://example.org/resource/catalog&gt; .

&lt;&gt; a dcat:Catalog ;
	dcat:datasets &lt;/datasets/&gt; ;
	dcat:dataset &lt;/datasets/001&gt; .

&lt;/datasets/&gt; a ldp:Container, ldp:DirectContainer ;
	ldp:membershipResource &lt;&gt; ;
	ldp:hasMemberRelation dcat:dataset ;
	ldp:contains &lt;/datasets/001&gt; .

&lt;/datasets/001&gt; a dcat:Dataset .</pre>
        </div>

        <p>
            In the second example, we add LDPCs <code>&lt;/records/&gt;</code> for Catalog Records and <code>&lt;/services/&gt;</code> for Data Services, discoverable using <code>dcat:records</code> and <code>dcat:services</code> predicates from the Catalog:
        </p>
        <div class="example">
            <div class="example-title marker">
                <span>Example 2</span>
            </div>
            <pre class="nohighlight turtle" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
@prefix dcat: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#&gt; .
@prefix ldp:  &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#&gt; .

&lt;&gt; a dcat:Catalog ;
	dcat:records &lt;/records/&gt; ;
	dcat:datasets &lt;/datasets/&gt; ;
	dcat:services &lt;/services/&gt; ;
	dcat:dataset &lt;/datasets/001&gt; .

&lt;/records/&gt; a ldp:Container, ldp:DirectContainer ;
	ldp:membershipResource &lt;&gt; ;
	ldp:hasMemberRelation dcat:record ;
	ldp:contains &lt;/records/001&gt; .

&lt;/datasets/&gt; a ldp:Container, ldp:DirectContainer ;
	ldp:membershipResource &lt;&gt; ;
	ldp:hasMemberRelation dcat:dataset ;
	ldp:contains &lt;/datasets/001&gt; .

&lt;/services/&gt; a ldp:Container, ldp:DirectContainer ;
	ldp:membershipResource &lt;&gt; ;
	ldp:hasMemberRelation dcat:service ;
	ldp:contains &lt;/services/001&gt; .

&lt;/records/001&gt; a dcat:CatalogRecord ;
	foaf:primaryTopic &lt;/datasets/001&gt; .

&lt;/datasets/001&gt; a dcat:Dataset ;

&lt;/services/001&gt; a dcat:DataService .</pre>
        </div>
        <p>
            Each dataset has its own LDPC for its distributions.
            In the third example, we show the LDPC <code>&lt;/datasets/001/distributions/&gt;</code> for distributions of a single dataset, <code>&lt;/datasets/001&gt;</code>, discoverable through the <code>dcat:distributions</code> predicate.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
            <div class="example-title marker">
                <span>Example 3</span>
            </div>

      <p>
          In many legacy catalogues and repositories (e.g. CKAN), ‘datasets’ are ‘just a bag of files’. There is no distinction made between part/whole, distribution (representation), and other kinds of relationship (e.g. documentation, schema, supporting documents) from the dataset to each of the files.
      </p>

          A terse description of the project is shown as a <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#Activity">prov:Activity</a>, though this would not necessarily be part of the same catalog.
          Note that as the project is ongoing, the activity has no end date.
      </p>
      <p>
          Further provenance information might be provided using the other <i>starting point properties</i> from PROV, in particular <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#wasAttributedTo">prov:wasAttributedTo</a> (to link to an agent associated with the dataset production) and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#wasDerivedFrom">prov:wasDerivedFrom</a> (to link to a predecessor dataset). Both of these complement Dublin Core properties already used in DCAT, as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              <b>prov:wasAttributedTo</b> provides a general link to all kinds of associated agents, such as project sponsors, managers, dataset owners, etc which are not correctly characterized using <b>dct:creator</b>, <b>dct:contributor</b> or <b>dct:publisher</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
              <b>prov:wasDerivedFrom</b> supports a more specific relationship to an input or predecessor dataset compared with <b>dct:source</b>, which is not necessarily a previous dataset.
          </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          For a more detailed discussion of the use of PROV for dataset provenance, including recommendations on the use of <i>qualified properties</i>, see the chapter on <a href="#prov-patterns">Provenance Patterns</a> below.

      <h3>Data services</h3>
      <p>
          Data services may be described using DCAT.
          The values of the classifiers <b>dct:type</b>, <b>dct:conformsTo</b>, and <b>dcat:endpointDescription</b> provide progressively more detail about a service, whose actual endpoint is given by the <b>dcat:endpointURL</b>.

    <section id="changes-since-20140116">
        <h3>Changes since the W3C Recommendation of 16 January 2014</h3>
        <p>The document has undergone the following changes since the W3C Recommendation of 16 January 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]]:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
              A new section <a href="#qualified-relationship">Relationships between datasets and other catalogued resources</a> and new property <a href="#resource_qualifiedRelation">dcat:qualifiedRelation</a> and class <a href="#Class:Relationship">dcat:Relationship</a> added to support relationships between datasets or other resources
          </li>

            <li>
                A new  section, <a href="#Dereferenceable-identifiers">Dereferenceable identifiers</a>, is added to describe how to indicate different types of identifiers by using [[DCTERMS]] and [[vocab-adms]] - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/53">Issue #53</a> and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/68">Issue #68</a>.
            </li>

            <li>
                A new section on <a href="#qualified-attribution">Attribution roles</a> was added to recommend a pattern for assigning an agent to a catalogued resource with a qualified relationship.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="#Property:hadRole">Property: had role</a>: The property dcat:hadRole is added to support the use of prov:qualifiedAttribution to associate an agent with a DCAT resource, where the role of the agent with relation to the resource is specified, and is something other than the standard Dublin Core roles: creator, publisher or contributor - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/79">Issue #79</a>
            </li>

            <li>
               The section <a href="#license-rights">License and rights statements</a> was added to describe patterns for linking dcat:Datasets and dcat:Distributions to the relevant license and rights expressions.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="#Property:dataset_creator">Property: dataset creator</a>: The property dct:creator is recommended for use in the context of a dataset to allow the entity responsible for generating the dataset to be recorded - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/61">Issue #61</a>
            </li>


            <li>
                <a href="#Property:dataset_wasgeneratedby">Property: was generated by</a>: The property prov:wasGeneratedBy is recommended for use in the context of a dataset to allow the provenance or business context to be recorded - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/71">Issue #71</a>
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="#Property:resource_relation">Property: resource relation</a>: The property dct:relation is recommended for use in the context of a catalogued resource to capture general relationships, including the case where the package of resources associated with a catalogued item includes a mixture of representations, parts, documentation and other elements which are not strictly 'distributions' of a dataset - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/253">Issue #253</a>.
            </li>


            <li>
                <a href="#Property:distribution_media_type">Property:media_type</a>: The range of dcat:mediaType has been tightened from dct:MediaTypeOrExtent to dct:MediaType - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/127">Issue #127</a>.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="#Property:distribution_conformsto">Property: conforms to</a>: The property dct:conformsTo is recommended for use in the context of a dcat:Distribution to allow the model or schema used for the representation to be indicated as well as the serialization (which is indicated using dct:format and dcat:mediaType) - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/55">Issue #55</a>.
            </li>

            <li>
                Errors in examples of <a href="#Property:distribution_media_type">dcat:mediaType</a> usage fixed - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/170">Issue #170</a>.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="#quality-information">Quality information</a>: Recommendations for how to associate quality information to datasets using elements from the W3C DQV vocabulary [[VOCAB-DQV]] are provided. Since [[VOCAB-DQV]] is not a rec-track document, these are non-normative - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/57">Issue #57</a> and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/58">Issue #58</a>.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="#Class:Resource">Class: Catalogued resource</a>: In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the scope of a <a href="#Class:Catalog">dcat:Catalog</a> was limited to Datasets. This has been generalized, and properties common to all catalogued resources are now associated with a super-class <code><a href="#Class:Resource">dcat:Resource</a></code> - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">Issue #172</a> and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/116">Issue #116</a>. The wiki page on <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/wiki/Cataloguing-data-services">Cataloguing data services</a> describes some proposals related to this requirement.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="#Class:Data_Service">Class: Data service</a>: In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the scope of a <a href="#Class:Catalog">dcat:Catalog</a> was limited to Datasets. The new class dcat:DataService has been added to support cataloguing various kinds of data services - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">Issue #172</a>.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="#Class:Data_Distribution_Service">Class: Data distribution service</a>: In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the scope of a <a href="#Class:Catalog">dcat:Catalog</a> was limited to Datasets. The new class dcat:DataDistributionService has been added to support cataloguing data distribution services - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">Issue #172</a> and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/56">Issue #56</a>.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="#Class:Discovery_Service">Class: Discovery service</a>: In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the scope of a <a href="#Class:Catalog">dcat:Catalog</a> was limited to Datasets. The new class dcat:DiscoveryService has been added to support cataloguing data discovery services - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">Issue #172</a>.
            </li>

            <li><a href="#Class:Dataset">Class: Dataset</a>:
                In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] <a href="#Class:Dataset">dcat:Dataset</a> was a sub-class of <a href="http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Dataset">dctype:Dataset</a>, which is a term of the <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#section-7">DCMI Types vocabulary</a> [[DCTERMS]]. This relationship has been removed in the revised DCAT vocabulary - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/98">Issue #98</a>.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="#Class:Distribution">Class: Distribution</a>
                : In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the definition of a <a href="#Class:Distribution">dcat:Distribution</a> allowed a number of alternative interpretations. The definition has been rephrased to clarify that distributions are primarily <i>representations</i> of datasets. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/172">Issue #52</a> and related use cases.
            </li>


            <li><a href="#Property:resource_theme">Property: theme/category</a>:
                In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the domain of dcat:theme was dcat:Dataset,
                which limited use of this property in other contexts. The domain has been relaxed in this revision -
                see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/123">Issue #123</a>.
            </li>

            <li><a href="#Property:resource_type">Property: type/genre</a>:
                Added in DCAT revision - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/64">Issue #64</a>, with examples of usage in overview section.
            </li>

            <li><a href="#Property:resource_keyword">Property: keyword/tag</a>:
                In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the domain of dcat:keyword was dcat:Dataset,
                which limited use of this property in other contexts. The domain has been relaxed in this revision -
                see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/121">Issue #121</a>.
            </li>

            <li><a href="#Property:resource_contact_point">Property: contact point</a>:
                In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the domain of dcat:contactPoint was dcat:Dataset,
                which limited use of this property in other contexts. The domain has been relaxed in this revision -
                see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/95">Issue #95</a>.
            </li>

            <li><a href="#Property:resource_landing_page">Property: landing page</a>:
                In DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] the domain of dcat:landingPage was dcat:Dataset,
                which limited use of this property in other contexts. The domain has been relaxed in this revision -
                see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/122">Issue #122</a>.
            </li>

            <li><a href="http://vocab.org/vann/#usageNote">Property: vann:usageNote</a>:
                DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] included documentation captured as text using <a href="http://vocab.org/vann/#usageNote">vann:usageNote</a> elements,
                which is a sub-property of rdfs:seeAlso - an owl:ObjectProperty that cannot have a Literal value.
                This revision of DCAT has fixed these issues and replaced the use of vann:usageNote with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/#secdocumentation">skos:scopeNote</a> -
                see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/233">Issue #233</a>.
            </li>

            <li><a href="#Property:record_conformsto">Property: conforms to </a>:
                DCAT 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] had no way of representing the conformance of a record metadata with a metadata standard. This revision has added the property dct:conformsTo for dcat:CatalogRecord to cover this requirement.
                - see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/502">Issue #502</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
