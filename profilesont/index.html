  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    The Profiles Vocabulary is an RDF vocabulary to describe profiles of (one or more) standards for information resources. It describes the general pattern of narrowing the scope of a specification with additional, but consistent, constraints, and is particularly relevant to data exchange situations where conformance to such profiles is expected and carries additional context.   The Profiles Vocabulary enables profile descriptions to specify the role of resources related to data exchange such as schemas, ontologies, rules about use of controlled vocabularies, validation tools, and guidelines. The ontology may however be used to describe the role of artifacts in any situation where constraints are made on a the usage of more general specifications.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    The namespace for PROF terms is <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/dx/prof/</code>.<br />
    The PROF vocabulary, defined in OWL and encoded in RDF Turtle, is available at <a href="profilesont.ttl">profilesont.ttl</a>.

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This Profiles Vocabulary provides a structure to describe profiles of information standards. Its
    development was triggered by the appearance of multiple profiles of the Dataset Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT)
    [[VOCAB-DCAT-20140116]] and examples of profiles including the Guidelines for Dublin Core Application Profiles [[DCAP]] and various profiles of OpenGeospatial Consortium specifications.
  </p>
  <p>The Profiles Vocabulary is an RDF vocabulary to describe the resources that define and implement a profile. A profile is defined as "A named set of constraints on one or more identified base specifications or other profiles, including the identification of any implementing subclasses of datatypes, semantic interpretations, vocabularies, options and parameters of those base specifications necessary to accomplish a particular function." These resources may be human-readable documents (PDFs, textual documents), vocabularies or ontologies (XSD, RDF),  resources specific to validation tools (SHACL, ShEx, Schematron), or any other files or resources that support the profile. Each resource is defined as having a role that defines its function within the profile.
	</p>
This vocabulary also provides for the description of relationships between such profiles and the standards to which they conform. A standard in this case can be a vocabulary or it can be another profile from which the described profile is a derivation, expansion, or selection. This vocabulary provides a standardized, machine readable formalism for describing the context of profiles. The basis of this vocabulary is a specialization of <code><a href="http://www.dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-Standard">dct:Standard</a></code>, allowing the use of the <code><a href="http://www.dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-conformsTo">dct:conformsTo</a></code> predicate to specify conformance to a profile.
	</p>
    A "profile" here is represented by the <a href="#Class:Profile">Profile class definition</a> in the
    <a href="#specification">Vocabulary Specification</a> with the following definition: "A named set of constraints on one or more identified base specifications or other profiles, including the identification of any implementing subclasses of datatypes, semantic interpretations, vocabularies, options and parameters of those base specifications necessary to accomplish a particular function."
  </p>
  <p>
    Profiles aim to increase interoperability within a community of users by introducing
    certain constraints on the use of a more general standard such as a published vocabulary. Such constraints include restrictions on the cardinality of certain
    properties, or a requirement to select values of a property from a specified controlled vocabulary. Profiles
    have generally been specified through textually-oriented documents, and/or platform specific constraint languages.

  <p>
    The namespace for PROF is <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/dx/prof/</code>.
    However, it should be noted that PROF makes use of terms from other vocabularies, in particular Dublin Core [[!DCTERMS]].
    PROF itself only defines a minimal set of classes and properties of its own.

<section id="motivation" class="informative">
  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>
    Until this vocabulary's creation, there was no formal W3C method for describing the objects (Internet resources) related to
    <em>profiles</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are a multitude of ways to describe the components needed to define a profile and support validation of instances, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>human-readable  documents stating requirements (e.g. [[PDF]]) </li>
    <li>usage and guidance notes</li>
    <li>machine readable constraint languages
  (e.g. the abstract (Dublin Core's Description Set Profiles [[DCDSP]]) ot the more concrete (SHACL [[SHACL]] &amp; ShEx
  [[SHEX]]).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Describing only the components within a profile via documents or constraint languages does not indicate many things
    either important or interesting to know about a profile such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>its dependence on standards or other profiles</li>
    <li>inheritance of profile information from the things being profiled, or</li>
    <li>related profile resources
      <ul>
        <li>
          guidance documents in addition to formal constraints
        </li>
        <li>
          equivalent constraints written in different constraint languages for different forms of resource, e.g.
          SHACL for RDF and Schematron [[SCHEMATRON]] for XML.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    With a mechanism to relate profiles to standards and other profiles, profile hierarchies can be established which
    will:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      assist with the reuse of existing profiles
      <ul>
        <li>
          one can profile another profile, adding a small set of additional constraints and declaring compatibility with all profiled standards.
        </li>
        <li>
          reducing the total effort and information necessary to specify a profile
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      allow for machine interpretation of profiles and automated profile negotiation with fallback options
      <ul>
        <li>
          if a client requests a profile which a server cannot deliver, a server may be able to instead deliver a
          more generic version of the requested resource, using a profile link to the thing it profiles
        </li>
        <li>
          a client may be able to generate a request that already indicates acceptable fallback options for resources
          when the primary requested profile is unavailable
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <section id="motivating-requirements">
    <h4>Motivating Requirements</h4>
    <p>
      For the purposes of dataset exchange and with the lack of a formal W3C method for describing the objects related
      to profiles, the DXWG underwent a process of Use Case and Requirements gathering. They established the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/">Dataset Exchange Use Case and Requirements</a> document
      (the UCR document) [[DCAT-UCR]] which groups requirements for profiles into the following sections:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#ProfileAbstractRequirements">6.10 Profiles — abstract requirements applying to the general definition of profiles</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#ProfileFunctionalityRequirements">6.11 Profiles — Profile functionality</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#ProfileDistributionRequirements">6.12 Profiles — Profile distributions</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#ProfileMetadataRequirements">6.13 Profiles — Profile metadata</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This Profiles Vocabulary document addresses many of those Requirements - those that can be addressed by describing
      profile components and relations - and the Requirements as described in the UCR document link back to the Use
      Cases that motivated them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, the UCR document lists a further profiles Requirements section:
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#ProfileNegotiationRequirements">6.14 Profile and content negotiation</a>
      however Requirements there are addressed by the related [[PROF-CONNEG]] document.

      This vocabulary is for describing relationships between standards/specifications, profiles of them and supporting artifacts such as validating resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      The model takes the <code><a href="http://www.dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-Standard">dct:Standard</a></code> Class as a starting point and defines a specialization, a <code>Profile</code>, which is a <code>dct:Standard</code> that <em>profiles</em> a <code>dct:Standard</code> or another <code>Profile</code>. <code>Standards</code>s or <code>Profile</code>s can have <code>Resource Descriptor</code>s associated with
    them that define rules for implementation, provide guidance on how to implement, or play some other role. <code>Resource Descriptor</code>s must indicate the role they
    play (to guide, to validate etc.), the formalism they adhere to (<code><a href="http://www.dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-format">dct:format</a></code>)
    and any <code>dct:Standard</code> that they themselves conform to (<code><a href="http://www.dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-conformsTo">dct:conformsTo</a></code>).
  </p>
  <p>
    A extensible vocabulary of <code>Resource Role</code>s is provided alongside this vocabulary.

        This vocabulary defines <a href="#Property:isTransitiveProfileOf">prof:isTransitiveProfileOf</a> to allow for the
        transitive interpretations of hierarchies of Profiles (of other Profiles and Standards) while freeing the
        simpler property, <a href="#Property:isProfileOf">prof:isProfileOf</a> from having to enforce transitivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this vocabulary provides this <code>prof:isProfileOf</code> &amp; <code>prof:isTransitiveProfileOf</code>
        pair of properties, it does not specify how a particular implementation of a Profile that is related to another
        Profile or Standard by <code>prof:isTransitiveProfileOf</code> should implement specific inferences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inference based on <code>prof:isTransitiveProfileOf</code> will be more complex than inference based on
        <code>skos:broaderTransitive</code> due to Profiles being complex objects relative to SKOS Concepts.

# A profile that is within a hierarchy of profiles may wish to indicate it profiles
# things "further up the chain". To do this, prof:isTransitiveProfileOf can be used
# to indicate anything the profile is related to by a series of one or more
# prof:isProfileOf properties.

# Here the New Zealand profile of the ISO addressing standard is presented in a chain
# of profiles:

@prefix dct: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt; .
@prefix prof: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/dx/prof/&gt; .
@prefix role: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/dx/prof/role/&gt; .
@prefix rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt; .

&lt;http://linked.data.gov.au/def/iso19160-1-address-nz-profile&gt;
  a prof:Profile ;
  rdfs:label "New Zealand Profile of ISO19160-1" ;
  rdfs:comment """This is a country-specific profile of the international
                  addressing standard, ISO19160-1:2015 (Address)""" ;
  prof:isProfileOf &lt;http://linked.data.gov.au/def/iso19160-1-address&gt; .

# The ISO thing that the NZ Profile profiles is actually a Web Ontology Language
# (OWL) version of the original ISO addressing standard
&lt;http://linked.data.gov.au/def/iso19160-1-address&gt;
  a prof:Profile ;
  rdfs:label "OWL Profile of ISO19160-1" ;
  rdfs:comment """This profile profiles both ISO19160-1 (Addressing) and also
                  the Web Ontology Language (OWL)""" ;
  prof:isProfileOf &lt;https://www.iso.org/standard/61710.html&gt; ,
                   &lt;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#&gt; .

&lt;https://www.iso.org/standard/61710.html&gt;
  a dct:Standard ;
  rdfs:label "ISO 19160-1:2015 Addressing -- Part 1: Conceptual model" .

# Now, according to the semantics of prof:isTransitiveProfileOf, using the
# prof:isProfileOf statements above, one can infer the following additional
# statements:

&lt;http://linked.data.gov.au/def/iso19160-1-address-nz-profile&gt;
  prof:isTransitiveProfileOf &lt;http://linked.data.gov.au/def/iso19160-1-address&gt; ,
                             &lt;https://www.iso.org/standard/61710.html&gt; ,
                             &lt;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#&gt; .

# These statements may help consumers understand which broad, well-known
# profiles data they have conforms to when they are presented only with its
# conformance to most specialised (lowest) profile in a hierarchy which they
# may not understand.

# In this example too, a user of the profile
# &lt;http://linked.data.gov.au/def/iso19160-1-address-nz-profile&gt; will also
# understand that data conforming to it is also conformant with OWL which is not
# in the direct hierarchy of addressing standards (iso19160-1-address-nz-profile >
# iso19160-1-address > ISO 19160-1:2015) but is critical to know about when using
# the specialised standard as it can indicate reasoning possibilities.

    <p><em>This example showcases this vocabulary's description of parts of an existing, well-known, profile.</em></p>
    <p>
      DCAT-AP is the widely used European <em>Application Profile</em> of DCAT. DCAT-AP is described in document form
      (PDF &amp; DOCX) and a constraints resource for instance validation is available, formulated using the W3C's Shapes
      Constraints Language constraints language [[SHACL]]. An image of the DCAT-AP model is also provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure uses elements from this vocabulary to describe part of the DCAT-AP Profile graphically - PDF &amp; RDF
      resources only - to simplify the example.

    <p><em>This example showcases this vocabulary being used to indicated profiles within a complex hierarchy.</em></p>
    <p>
      DCAT-AP, a profile of DCAT, has itself been profiled for various European countries, such as Belgium who has
      issued <a href="http://dcat.be/">DCAT-BE</a>. Additionally, there are several domain profiles of DCAT-AP, such as
      [[GeoDCAT-AP]] - for describing geospatial datasets,
      dataset series and services - and [[StatDCAT-AP]]
      for enhancing interoperability between descriptions of statistical datasets. Further to this, there is even an
      Italian profile of GeoDCAT-AP, <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/news/geodcat-apit">GeoDCAT-AP_IT</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This profile hierarchy is represented graphically in the figure and RDF (turtle) below.

      Since there are no cardinality restrictions on either the property <code>prof:isProfileOf</code> or other restrictions on the class definition of
      <code>prof:Profile</code> that prevent them from being used to represent polyhierarchies, Belgium could release a
      profile of [[StatDCAT-AP]] (e.g., StatDCAT-BE), that would be both a profile of DCAT-BE and [[StatDCAT-AP]]. This
      imagined profile, '?' in the figure above, would not be a profile of GeoDCAT-AP.

    <h3>CSIRO Dummy Dublin Core AP</h3>

      <em>
        This example uses a dummy profile created for this document to show how PROF describes profiles created
        according to the Guidelines for Dublin Core Application Profiles [[DCAP]].
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The DCAP Guidelines document "explains the key components of a Dublin Core Application Profile and walks through
      the process of developing a profile". It "does not address the creation of machine-readable implementations of an
      application profile" which is what PROF does.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this example, a dummy profile of Dublin Core TERMS [[DCTERMS]] is created to characterise documents in a
      hypothetical "ePublish" platform. The dummy profile contains many parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a profile overview document</li>
      <li>a <em>How To</em> document offering guidance on how to use the profile</li>
      <li>two constraint language files - both conforming to DCAP's constraint syntax in plain text and RDF (turtle) formats</li>
      <li>two profile description files - one an image (the <a href="#fig-eg-csiro-dummy-dcap"></a> below) and the other an RDF file (the example RDF below)</li>

    </p>
    <p>
      Communities commonly make profiles of the International Organization for Standardization's standard
      ISO19115-1:2014 Geographic information -- Metadata -- Part 1: Fundamentals used for cataloguing spatial datasets.
      <a href="http://www.ga.gov.au">Geoscience Australia</a>, Australia's national geological survey agency, has
      created a profile that constrains ISO19115-1:2014 in ways such as making optional properties in the standard
      mandatory for profile conformance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GA Profile of ISO19115 is published online as a collection of resources with an index document with the persistent URI
      <a href="http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/def/schema/ga/ISO19115-1-2014">http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/def/schema/ga/ISO19115-1-2014</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although not initially formulated with PROF in mind, nevertheless the various parts of the GA Profile of ISO19115
      can be characterised using PROF as per <a href="#fig-eg-ga"></a> and the example RDF below. Note that the
      persistent URIs assigned to the profile by Geoscience Australia are used within the PROF description.

      The Asset Description Metadata Schema (ADMS) [[VOCAB-ADMS]] is a profile of DCAT, used to describe semantic
      assets. Both ADMS the <code>Profile</code> and two of its <code>Resource Descriptors</code> are published
      according to W3C specifications for <em>Recommendations</em> and <em>Working Group Notes</em>.

        Using this vocabulary, a <em>Profile</em> may indicate a <em>Resource Descriptor</em> instance by way of the
        <em>resource</em> property. That <em>Resource Descriptor</em> may be a schema that <em>conformsTo</em> a
        constraints language, such as SHACL etc.

    <div class="issue" data-number="280"></div>

    <div class="issue" data-number="284"></div>
    <div class="req-response">
      <p class="respTitle">RESPONSE FOR 284</p>
      <p>
        Using this vocabulary, all <em>Profile</em> instances are RDF <em>Resources</em> with their own URIs.
        Additionally, the <em>token</em> property is given for use with a <em>Profile</em> to be used to identify it
        where use of a full URI is not possible, such as within HTTP Query String Arguments.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="issue" data-number="286"></div>
    <div class="req-response">
      <p class="respTitle">RESPONSE FOR 286</p>
      <p>
        Following relationships from a profile defined using this vocabulary, a person or machine may discover either
        <em>Resource Descriptor</em> resources describing any sort of document relevant to the profile or other
        <em>Profile</em>s.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="issue" data-number="287"></div>
    <div class="req-response">

    <div class="issue" data-number="288"></div>
    <div class="req-response">
      <p class="respTitle">RESPONSE FOR 288</p>
      <p>
        Graph navigation of profiles' information described using this vocabulary is supported by its RDF mechanics.
      </p>
      <p>
        An instance of a resource claiming adherence to an instance of a <em>Profile</em> might indicate its adherence
        by using the <em>dct:conformsTo</em> property.
