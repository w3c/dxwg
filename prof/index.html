  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    The Profiles Vocabulary is an RDF vocabulary created to allow the machine-readable description of profiles of
    specifications for information resources. It can be used to describe profile hierarchies wherein profiles of
    specifications may themselves have profiles indicated. It can also link multiple profile resources that make up a profile
    - guidelines, validation tools, schemas, term lists and so on - to it and allows for those profile resources to be
    described with formats, roles, and digital artifacts.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    The namespace for PROF terms is <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/dx/prof/</code>.<br />
    The PROF vocabulary, defined in OWL and encoded in RDF Turtle, is available at <a href="rdf/prof.ttl">prof.ttl</a>.

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This Profiles Vocabulary (PROF) provides a standardized, structured and human- &amp; machine-readable set of terms
    to describe profiles. Its development was triggered by the appearance of multiple profiles of the Dataset Catalog
    Vocabulary (DCAT) [[VOCAB-DCAT]] and examples of profile description and implementation guidance systems such as
    the Guidelines for Dublin Core Application Profiles [[DCAP]] and the OpenGeospatial Consortium's Standard for
    Modular specifications [[MODSPEC]].
  </p>
  <p>
    Profiles aim to increase interoperability within a community of users by introducing constraints, extensions or
    combinations on the use of more general specifications. PROF is an RDF vocabulary created
    to describe relations between <a>specifications</a> and <a>profiles</a> and the profile resources that define and implement
    profiles. A <em>specification</em> is "A basis for comparison; a reference point against which other things
    can be evaluated." (see the definition below) and a <em>profile</em>, perhaps an
    <em>application profile</em>, is defined as "A [data/application] specification that constrains, extends, combines,
    or provides guidance or explanation about the usage of other [data/application] specifications". Profile resources
    may be human-readable documents (PDFs, textual documents), vocabularies, schemas or ontologies (XSD, RDF),
    constraint language resources used by specific validation tools (SHACL, ShEx, Schematron), or any other files or
    profile resources that support the profile. In this specification, each profile resource is able to have roles
    assigned to it that define its functions within the profile.
	</p>
  <p>
    This vocabulary's ontological basis for specification/profile relations is a specialization of the
    <code><a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#terms-Standard">dct:Standard</a></code>
    class which is defined here as a <code><a href="#Class:Profile">prof:Profile</a></code>. A <code>prof:Profile</code>
    instance is related to either <code>dct:Standard</code> or <code>prof:Profile</code> instances by being a <em>profile of</em>
    them, formally, <a href="#Property:isProfileOf"><code>prof:isProfileOf</code></a>. Resources that conform to either a
    <code>dct:Standard</code> or a <code>prof:Profile</code> are formally described as doing so with the use of the
    <code><a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#terms-conformsTo">dct:conformsTo</a></code>
    predicate.
	</p>
  <p>
    Data that conforms to a profile, in PROF, must conform to anything the profile is a profile of. To represent this formally, this vocabulary
    includes the property chain axiom <code>dct:conformsTo owl:propertyChainAxiom ( prof:isProfileOf dct:conformsTo )</code>.
    Individual communities may define what conformance to their profiles and the things they profile means and how to
    test for conformance if indeed they wish to.
  </p>
  <p>
    In recognition of the existence of specifications and profiles that are made up of multiple resources &ndash;
    perhaps PDF documents, machine-readable constraint language files, code lists etc. &ndash; this vocabulary also
    provides for the description of the parts that constitute a profile or a specification. It defines a
    <a href="#Class:ResourceDescriptor"><code>prof:ResourceDescriptor</code></a> class which is used to qualify the
    relationship between a profile and profile resources. A <code>prof:Profile</code> may have any number of
    <a href="#Property:hasResource"><code>prof:hasResource</code></a> predicates indicating <code>prof:ResourceDescriptor</code>
    instances which then indicate the location (a URI) of the actual profile resource artifact with a
    <a href="#Property:hasArtifact"><code>prof:hasArtifact</code></a> predicate and then may describes the artifact's
    format and any specifications it conforms to with <a href="#Property:format"><code>dct:format</code></a> &amp;
    <a href="#Property:conformsTo"><code>dct:conformsTo</code></a> predicates respectively. The role that the profile resource
    plays with respect to the profile may be indicating using a <a href="#Class:ResourceRole"><code>prof:ResourceRole</code></a>
    class instance linked to it with the <a href="#Property:hasRole"><code>prof:hasRole</code></a> predicate.
  </p>
  <p>
    A vocabulary of <code>prof:ResourceRole</code> instances is provided in <a href="#resource-roles-vocab"></a> but
    communities are encouraged to create additional <code>prof:ResourceRole</code> instances with definitions suited to
    their purposes and, in the best case, to publish those additional instances for others to reuse.

    PROF itself only defines a small set of classes and properties of its own.
  </p>
  <p>
    PROF also makes use of derivative namespaces of its own namespace for auxiliary vocabulary elements, such as instances

<section id="motivation" class="informative">
  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>
    Until this vocabulary's creation, there was no formal W3C method for describing <a>profile</a> objects (Internet resources).
  </p>
  <p>
    There are a multitude of possible ways to describe the components needed to define a profile and support validation of data
    claiming conformance to profiles, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>human-readable documents stating requirements (e.g. [[PDF]]) </li>
    <li>usage and guidance notes</li>
    <li>
      machine readable constraint languages (e.g. the abstract (Dublin Core's Description Set Profiles [[DCDSP]]) or
      the more concrete (SHACL [[SHACL]] &amp; ShEx [[SHEX]]).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Describing the components within a profile with documents or constraint languages only does not indicate many things
    that may be important or interesting to know about a profile such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>its dependence on standards or other profiles</li>
    <li>inheritance of profile information from the things being profiled, or</li>
    <li>related profile resources
      <ul>
        <li>
          guidance documents in addition to formal constraints
        </li>
        <li>
          equivalent constraints written in different constraint languages for different forms of profile resource, e.g. SHACL
          for RDF and Schematron [[SCHEMATRON]] for XML.
        </li>
        <li>
          supporting vocabularies of terms (code lists)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Regarding profile/specification relations, a mechanism to relate profiles to specifications and other profiles,
    would allow both immediate knowledge of what things a profile profiles and also allow profile hierarchies to be established
    which could:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      assist with the reuse of existing profiles
      <ul>
        <li>
          one can profile another profile, adding a small set of additional constraints and declaring compatibility
          with all profiled specifications.
        </li>
        <li>
          reducing the total effort and information necessary to specify a profile
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      allow for machine interpretation of profiles and automated profile negotiation with fallback options
      <ul>
        <li>
          if a client requests a profile which a server cannot deliver, a server may be able to instead deliver a more
          generic version of the requested data resource, using a profile link to the thing it profiles
        </li>
        <li>
          a client may be able to generate a request that already indicates acceptable fallback options for data resources
          when the primary requested profile is unavailable
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

    <h4>Motivating Requirements</h4>
    <p>
      For the purposes of dataset exchange and with the lack of a formal W3C method for describing the objects related
      to profiles, the DXWG undertook a process of Use Case and Requirements gathering. They established the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/">Dataset Exchange Use Case and Requirements</a> document
      (the UCR document) [[DCAT-UCR]] which groups requirements for profiles into the following sections:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#ProfileAbstractRequirements">6.10 Profiles — abstract requirements applying to the general definition of profiles</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#ProfileFunctionalityRequirements">6.11 Profiles — Profile functionality</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#ProfileDistributionRequirements">6.12 Profiles — Profile distributions</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#ProfileMetadataRequirements">6.13 Profiles — Profile metadata</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      PROF addresses many of those Requirements &ndash; those that can be addressed by describing
      profile components and relations &ndash; and those Requirements link back to the Use
      Cases that motivated them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The UCR document lists a further profiles Requirements section:
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#ProfileNegotiationRequirements">6.14 Profile and content negotiation</a>
      however those are not addressed here but by the related [[DX-PROF-CONNEG]] document.

  <h2>Related Work</h2>
  <p>
    Here several RDF vocabularies related to PROF are described as well as non-RDF initiatives and models.
  </p>
  <section id="related-owl">
    <h3>Web Ontology Language (OWL)</h3>
    <p>
      OWL [[OWL2-OVERVIEW]] is an RDF-based ontology language that provides for the description of classes, properties,
      individuals, and data values which are stored as Semantic Web documents. PROF uses many OWL properties, classes
      and structures and is easily recognized as a specialized OWL ontology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding profiling, none of the various OWL (or the updated OWL2) specifications directly address profiling, as
      it's understood here, however OWL does include "ontology properties" that "can be used to associate information
      with an ontology" [[OWL2-RDF-BASED-SEMANTICS]] (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/#Ontology_Annotations">&#167; 3.5 Ontology Annotations</a>).
      In particular, the ontology and annotation property <code>owl:imports</code> allows an ontology to indicate that
      it <em>imports</em> other ontology[ies] "in order to gain access to their entities, expressions, and axioms,
      thus providing the basic facility for ontology modularization" (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/#Imports">&#167; 3.4 Imports</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Within OWL, the definition of <code>owl:imports</code> is not associated with any axioms that permit reasoning with
      it and it is mostly used by ontology editing software to
      manipulate ontology data by importing it from remote (online) locations, as a technical convenience mechanism.
      Since an ontology that imports another includes all the axioms of the imported ontology, data which conforms to an
      ontology <em>x</em> will necessarily conform to any ontology that <em>x</em> imports too.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using OWL (and RDF [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]] &amp; RDF Schema [[RDF-SCHEMA]]) it is
      possible to know, on a per-class or property basis, that data elements conform to particular
      ontologies through inspection of those elements. Data that uses OWL
      declares classes and properties as being of types &ndash; particular classes or properties &ndash; by using
      <code>rdf:type</code> &ndash; <code>:myNewClassInstance rdf:type ex:SomeExistingClass</code> &ndash; which claims the data
      conforms to the indicated class or property. Newly declared classes and properties in ontologies may also claim conformance
       to existing classes or properties by using <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> or <code>rdfs:subPropertyOf</code>
      respectively.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="related-dcat">
    <h3>Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT)</h3>
    <p>
      DCAT was originally published as a W3C Recommendation in 2014 [[VOCAB-DCAT]] and has now been revised by the DXWG
      [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]]. The revised version is backward-compatible with the original and the intention of the vocabulary
      &ndash; to facilitate interoperability between data catalogs published on the Web &ndash; is unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Original and revised DCAT allow for the descriptions of <code>dcat:Catalog</code> instances which contain
      <code>dcat:Dataset</code> instances which may be <em>distributed</em> &ndash; delivered in a specific form &ndash;
      as <code>dcat:Distribution</code> instances.
    </p>
    <p>
      PROF borrows its main structures from DCAT in that PROF's <code>prof:Profile</code> &amp; <code>prof:ResourceDescriptor</code>
      classes parallel DCAT's <code>dcat:Dataset</code> &amp; <code>dcat:Distribution</code> classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main subject that differentiates PROF from DCAT is that PROF specifically addresses the notion of conformance
      &ndash; of <a>profiles</a> to <a>specifications</a> or other profiles &ndash; about which DCAT is silent. DCAT
      does address the notion of instance data conforming to an "established standard" (see it's suggested use of the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/#Property:resource_conforms_to"><code>dct:conformsTo</code> property</a>
      and here &ndash; instance data conformance to specifications &ndash; DCAT and PROF offer compatible instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      No normative alignment between DCAT &amp PROF is presented in this document however they can and should be used
      together and informative alignment between them (with revised DCAT [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]]) is given in
      <a href="#alignment-dcat"></a>.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="related-adms">
    <h3>Asset Description Metadata Schema (ADMS)</h3>
    <p>
      ADMS [[VOCAB-ADMS]] is "a profile of DCAT, used to describe <em>semantic assets</em>" and, as such, follows DCAT's structures
      with many class alignments including <code>adms:Asset</code> &amp; <code>adms:AssetDistribution</code> classes
      which parallel DCAT's <code>dcat:Dataset</code> &amp; <code>dcat:Distribution</code> classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADMS has been specifically designed for documenting an "asset", not only to make it discoverable, but also to
      provide contextual information (e.g., who's the publisher, which versions of an asset exist, etc.) and does not
      specifically address the core motivating notion for PROF of relating to conformance between profiles and
      specifications or profiles. In this regard, the relation of PROF to ADMS is similar to that of PROF to DCAT: there
      is some overlap with respect to class structures and the recommended use of particular annotation properties
      &ndash; title, description, etc. &ndash; for class instances.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with DCAT, PROF can and should be used with ADMS however no normative alignment between them is presented here
      but an informative alignment is given in <a href="#alignment-adms"></a>.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="related-prov">
    <h3>PROV-O: The PROV Ontology</h3>
    <p>
      PROV-O [[PROV-O]] is an ontology that "provides a set of classes, properties, and restrictions that can be used
      to represent and interchange provenance information". Further: "It can also be specialized to create new classes
      and properties to model provenance information for different applications and domains.".
    </p>
    <p>
      PROV-O is concerned with <em>derivation</em> of things from other things (<code>prov:Entity</code>s from
      <code>prov:Entity</code>s), <em>usage/generation</em> of things by events (<code>prov:Entity</code>s from
      <code>prov:Activity</code>s), attribution of things to things with agency (<code>prov:Entity</code>s to
      <code>prov:Agent</code>s) and the association of events with things with agency and these concerns are presented
      as a series of "Starting Point classes and properties" with many "Expanded and qualified classes and properties"
      that can be used to specialise their use.
    </p>
    <p>
      PROV-O does not address notions of conformance &ndash; of data to specifications/profiles or specifications/
      profiles to other specifications/profiles &ndash; however the DXWG debated whether <code>prof:isProfileOf</code>
      could be considered a sub-property of PROV-O's <code>prov:wasDerivedFrom</code> (see discussion within
      <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/485">DXWG's Issue 485</a>). The outcome of that discussion was that
      DXWG felt that since <code>prov:wasDerivedFrom</code> doesn’t say anything about dependency but that
      <code>prof:isProfileOf</code> does, it would be of no value to make an <code>rdfs:subPropertyOf</code> assertion
      between the two properties. Moreover, <code>prof:isProfileOf</code>'s dependency assertion is seen as conceptual
      rather than axiomatic so it would be difficult to define an axiom that could be true in a wide variety of cases.
    </p>

    <h3>The VoID Vocabulary</h3>
    <p>
      "VoID is an RDF Schema vocabulary for expressing metadata about RDF datasets." [[VOID]]. It provides for the
      describing of partitioned datasets and links between datasets. It is able to do this since, unlike DCAT (and ADMS),
      it caters for datasets only, not datasets in general, and thus is able to know about dataset's structure (as RDF
      triples) and therefore how to describe parts within datasets.
    </p>
    <p>
      VoID also allows for indications of how one RDF dataset <em>uses</em> uses one or more RDFS vocabularies or OWL
      ontologies. For example, a dataset may indicate the most important, not necessarily all, of the vocabularies it
      uses with the <code>void:vocabulary</code> predicate with the used vocabulary's namespaces URI as the object value.
      This is similar to OWL's [[OWL2-PRIMER]] <code>owl:imports</code> in that this is an annotation property and does
      not make any strong axiomatic claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      VoID does not address <em>dependence</em> or <em>conformance</em> of data resource on or to other data resources.

      VOAF declares a <code>voaf:Vocabulary</code> class for identifying RDF vocabularies in order to associate its
      properties with them and also makes references to datasets that use vocabulary data. It uses VoID's <code>void:Dataset</code>
      class to identify datasets and <code>voaf:Vocabulary</code> is declared as being a sub class of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      VOAF includes a series of predicates to indicate specific relationships between vocabularies and those related to
      profiling-like activities are given in the table below.

    <h3>Constraint Languages</h3>
    <p>
      Constraint languages such as [[SHACL]], [[SHEX]], [[SCHEMATRON]] and the [[DCDSP]] defined rules for validating
      the conformance of instance data against sets of conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constraint Languages are frequently used in profile definitions &ndash; see <a href="#examples"></a> &ndash;
      but they may not be all that is needed for a complete definition: frequently profiles also include guidance
      documents, examples of use and other profile resources too.
    </p>
    <p>
      PROF does include the possibility of defining profile parts via instances of the <code>prof:ResourceDescriptor</code>
      class with roles via the <code>prof:hasRole</code> property. Using these, profiles may indicate constraint
      language profile resources with an appropriate role, such as "constraints" or "validation". The list of
      <code>prof:ResourceRoles</code> instances given in <a href="#resource-roles-vocab"></a> may be extended by PROF users
      if appropriate roles for their constraint language resource are not found.
    </p>
    <p>
      PROF does not define any new constraint languages or indicate particular languages for use; this is left to
      individual communities to determine.

  <p>
    This vocabulary is for describing relationships between standards/specifications, profiles of them and supporting artifacts such as validating resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    The model takes the <code><a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#terms-Standard">dct:Standard</a></code> Class as a starting point and defines a specialization, a <code>Profile</code>, which is a <code>dct:Standard</code> that <em>profiles</em> a <code>dct:Standard</code> or another <code>Profile</code>. <code>Standards</code>s or <code>Profile</code>s can have <code>Resource Descriptor</code>s associated with
  them that define rules for implementation, provide guidance on how to implement, or play some other role. <code>Resource Descriptor</code>s must indicate the role they
  play (to guide, to validate etc.), the formalism they adhere to (<code><a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#terms-format">dct:format</a></code>)
  and any <code>dct:Standard</code> that they themselves conform to (<code><a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#terms-conformsTo">dct:conformsTo</a></code>).
  </p>
  <p>
    Any <code>rdfs:Resource</code> MAY indicate conformance to a profile as per <a href="#eg-conformance-to-profile"></a>
    by using <code>dct:conformsTo</code>. Individual communities MAY determine what constitutes an appropriate URI to
    identify a profile.

                A Profile may define constraints on the usage of one or more specifications. All constraints of these specifications are inherited, in the sense that an object conforming to a profile conforms to all the constraints specified the targets of prof:isProfileOf relations. This property is optional, allowing any specification to be declared at the root of a profile hierarchy using the Profile class.
              </p>
              <p>
                Note that the axiom within this vocabulary that allows the inference that conformance to a profile means conformance to anything it profiles is part of the definition <code><a href="#Property:conformsTo"></a></code>.

              <p>
                The use of this prof:isTransitiveProfileOf as a super-property of prof:isProfileOf allows communities of practice to exploit transitive interpretations of hierarchical network of profiles as they see fit, while not interfering with the semantics of prof:isProfileOf, which cannot enforce such transitivity. Intuitively, one can interpret prof:isProfileOf statements as explicitly asserted direct profiling links, while prof:isTransitiveProfileOf is used to reflect more-general (and possibly indirect) ancestor relationships.

# These statements may help consumers understand which broad, well-known

# conformance to most specialised (lowest) profile in a hierarchy which they
# may not understand.

# In this example too, a user of the profile
# &lt;http://linked.data.gov.au/def/iso19160-1-address-nz-profile&gt; will also
# understand that data conforming to it is also conformant with OWL which is not
# in the direct hierarchy of addressing standards (iso19160-1-address-nz-profile >
# iso19160-1-address > ISO 19160-1:2015) but is critical to know about when using
# the specialised standard as it can indicate reasoning possibilities.

    <h3>DCAT-AP hierarchy</h3>
    <p><em>This example showcases this vocabulary being used to indicated profiles within a complex hierarchy.</em></p>
    <p>
      DCAT-AP, a profile of DCAT, has itself been profiled for various European countries, such as Belgium who has
      issued <a href="http://dcat.be/">DCAT-BE</a>. Additionally, there are several domain profiles of DCAT-AP, such as
      [[GeoDCAT-AP]] - for describing geospatial datasets,
      dataset series and services - and [[StatDCAT-AP]]
      for enhancing interoperability between descriptions of statistical datasets. Further to this, there is even an
      Italian profile of GeoDCAT-AP, <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semantic-interoperability-community-semic/news/geodcat-apit">GeoDCAT-AP_IT</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This profile hierarchy is represented graphically in the figure and RDF (turtle) below.

      Since there are no cardinality restrictions on either the property <code>prof:isProfileOf</code> or other restrictions on the class definition of
      <code>prof:Profile</code> that prevent them from being used to represent polyhierarchies, Belgium could release a
      profile of [[StatDCAT-AP]] (e.g., StatDCAT-BE), that would be both a profile of DCAT-BE and [[StatDCAT-AP]]. This
      imagined profile, '?' in the figure above, would not be a profile of GeoDCAT-AP.

    <h3>CSIRO Dummy Dublin Core AP</h3>

      <em>
        This example uses a dummy profile created for this document to show how PROF describes profiles created
        according to the Guidelines for Dublin Core Application Profiles [[DCAP]].
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The DCAP Guidelines document "explains the key components of a Dublin Core Application Profile and walks through
      the process of developing a profile". It "does not address the creation of machine-readable implementations of an
      application profile" which is what PROF does.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this example, a dummy profile of Dublin Core TERMS [[DCTERMS]] is created to characterise documents in a
      hypothetical "ePublish" platform. The dummy profile contains many parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a profile overview document</li>
      <li>a <em>How To</em> document offering guidance on how to use the profile</li>
      <li>two constraint language files - both conforming to DCAP's constraint syntax in plain text and RDF (turtle) formats</li>
      <li>two profile description files - one an image (the <a href="#fig-eg-csiro-dummy-dcap"></a> below) and the other an RDF file (the example RDF below)</li>

    <h3>Geoscience Australia's Profile of ISO19115-1:2014</h3>

      <em>This example shows a non-RDF profile of a non-RDF standard: ISO19115-1:2014 (Geographic information) [[ISO-19115-1-2014]].</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Communities commonly make profiles of the International Organization for Standardization's standard
      ISO19115-1:2014 Geographic information -- Metadata -- Part 1: Fundamentals used for cataloguing spatial datasets.
      <a href="http://www.ga.gov.au">Geoscience Australia</a>, Australia's national geological survey agency, has
      created a profile that constrains ISO19115-1:2014 in ways such as making optional properties in the standard
      mandatory for profile conformance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GA Profile of ISO19115 is published online as a collection of profile resources with an index document with the persistent URI
      <a href="http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/def/schema/ga/ISO19115-1-2014">http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/def/schema/ga/ISO19115-1-2014</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although not initially formulated with PROF in mind, nevertheless the various parts of the GA Profile of ISO19115
      can be characterised using PROF as per <a href="#fig-eg-ga"></a> and the example RDF below. Note that the
      persistent URIs assigned to the profile by Geoscience Australia are used within the PROF description.

    <h3>Dataset Catalogue Vocabulary</h3>
    <p>
      PROF is considered a specialisation of the revised version of the Dataset Catalogue Vocabulary [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]]
      for the purpose of cataloguing profiles. With this in mind, the main PROF classes - <code>Profile</code> and
      <code>Resource Descriptor</code> - specialise (are sub classes of) DCAT's <code>Resource</code> and
      <code>Distributions</code> respectively. This alignment is not normative, but is provided as a recommended way
      to consider general metadata needs when describing profiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      These specialisations are indicated in <a href="#fig-align-dcat"></a> below as well as the data element mapping
      table that follows it.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>The following table relates PROF and DCAT elements.</p>
    <table id="alignment-dcat-table">
      <thead>
      <tr><th>PROF element</th><th>Mapping property</th><th>DCAT element</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>prof:Profile</td><td style="text-align: center;"><code>rdfs:subClassOf</code></td><td>dcat:Resource</td><td><code>prof:Profile</code> is not a sub class of <code>dcat:Dataset</code></td></tr>
        <tr><td>prof:ResourceDescriptor</td><td style="text-align: center;"><code>rdfs:subClassOf</code></td><td>dcat:Distribution</td><td></td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      While DCAT is referenced in the main PROF RDF file, the following separate RDF file contains just the mappings
      included in the table above too:

    <h3>Asset Description Metadata Schema</h3>
    <p>
      The Asset Description Metadata Schema (ADMS) [[VOCAB-ADMS]] is a profile of DCAT, used to describe semantic
      assets. PROF is aligned with ADMS as per <a href="#fig-align-adms"></a> and table below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to PROF being aligned with the revised version of DCAT and ADMS also being aligned with DCAT, classes and
      properties of the two vocabularies may be sensibly used beyond the mappings presented here. In particular the fact
      that both <code>prof:Profile</code> and <code>adms:Asset</code> are non-disjoint sub classes of
      <code>dcat:Resource</code>, albeit that the latter is such via being a sub class of <code>dcat:Dataset</code>
      which subclasses <code>dcat:Resource</code>, means that data resources could easily be dually typed as being of both
      <code>prof:Profile</code> and <code>adms:Asset</code>.

      PROF is a vocabulary formulated using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) [[OWL2-OVERVIEW]]. In addition to the basic

      The Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) [[SKOS-REFERENCE]] is a data model knowledge organization
      systems, such as thesauri, taxonomies, classification schemes and subject heading systems. PROF declares its
      instances of <code>Resource Role</code> to be instances of the <code>skos:Concept</code> class to indicate that
      they should be considered a hierarchy of concepts within a <code>skos:ConceptScheme</code>. Since they are SKOS
      hierarchy and it is recommended that implementers of PROF extend the hierarchy for their own needs, implementers
      should consider creating new <code>Resource Role</code> (also <code>skos:Concept</code>) and relating them to the
      existing instances with SKOS properties, particularly <code>skos:narrower</code>/<code>skos:broader</code>.

  <h2>Security and Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The PROF vocabulary, when used with likely extensions such as [[DCTERMS]], supports the attribution of data and
    metadata to various participants such as data resource <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator">creators</a>,
    <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/publisher">publishers</a> and other parties or agents via <em>qualified
    relations</em> and, as such, may define terms that may be related to personal information.  In addition, it may also
    be used with extensions that support the association of <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/rights">rights</a> and
    <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/license">licenses</a> with modelled Profiles and Resource Descriptors.
    These rights and licenses could potentially include or reference sensitive information such as user and asset
    identifiers as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#privacy-consideration">described</a> in [[ODRL-VOCAB]].
    Implementations that produce, maintain, publish or consume such vocabulary terms must take steps to ensure security
    and privacy considerations are addressed at the application level.
