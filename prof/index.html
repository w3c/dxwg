  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    The Profiles Vocabulary is an RDF vocabulary created to allows the machine-readable description of profiles of
    specifications for information resources. It can be used to describe profile hierarchies wherein profiles of
    specifications may themselves have profiles indicated. It can also link multiple resources that make up a profile
    - guidelines, validation tools, schemas, term lists and so on - to it and allows for those resources have formats,
    roles, and digital artifacts to be described.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    The namespace for PROF terms is <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/dx/prof/</code>.<br />
    The PROF vocabulary, defined in OWL and encoded in RDF Turtle, is available at <a href="rdf/profilesont.ttl">profilesont.ttl</a>.

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This Profiles Vocabulary (PROF) provides a standardized, structured and human- &amp; machine-readable set of terms
    to describe profiles. Its development was triggered by the appearance of multiple profiles of the Dataset Catalog
    Vocabulary (DCAT) [[VOCAB-DCAT]] and examples of profile description and implementation guidance systems such as
    the Guidelines for Dublin Core Application Profiles [[DCAP]] and the OpenGeospatial Consortium's Standard for
    Modular specifications [[MODSPEC]].
  </p>
  <p>
    Profiles aim to increase interoperability within a community of users by introducing constraints, extensions or
    combinations on the use of more general specifications. PROF is an RDF vocabulary created
    to describe relations between <a>specifications</a> and profiles and the resources that define and implement
    <a>profiles</a>. A <em>specification</em> is "A basis for comparison; a reference point against which other things
    can be evaluated." (see the definition below) and a A profile, such as a <a>profile</a> or perhaps an
    <em>application profile</em>, is defined as "A [data/application] specification that constrains, extends, combines,
    or provides guidance or explanation about the usage of other [data/application] specifications". Profile resources
    may be human-readable documents (PDFs, textual documents), vocabularies, schemas or ontologies (XSD, RDF),
    constraint language resources used by specific validation tools (SHACL, ShEx, Schematron), or any other files or
    resources that support the profile. In this specification, each resource is defined as having a role that defines
    its function within the profile.
	</p>
  <p>
    This vocabulary's ontological basis for specification/profile relations is a specialization of the
    <code><a href="http://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#terms-Standard">dct:Standard</a></code>
    class which is defined here as a <code><a href="#Class:Profile">prof:Profile</a></code>. A <code>prof:Profile</code>
    is related to either <code>dct:Standard</code> or <code>prof:Profile</code> instances by being a <em>profile of</em>
    it, formally, <a href="#Property:isProfileOf"><code>prof:isProfileOf</code></a>. Resources that conform to either a
    <code>dct:Standard</code> or a <code>prof:Profile</code> are formally described as doing so with the use of the
    <code><a href="http://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#terms-conformsTo">dct:conformsTo</a></code>
    predicate.
	</p>
  <p>
    In recognition of the existence of specifications and profiles that are made up of multiple resources &ndash;
    perhaps PDF documents, machine-readable constraint language files, code lists etc. &ndash; this vocabulary also
    provides for the description of the parts that constitute a profile or a specification. It defines a
    <a href="#Class:ResourceDescriptor"><code>prof:ResourceDescriptor</code></a> class which is used to qualify the
    relationship between a profile and its part resources. A <code>prof:Profile</code> may have any number of
    <a href="#Property:hasResource"><code>prof:hasResource</code></a> predicates indicating <code>prof:ResourceDescriptor</code>
    instances which then indicates the location (a URI) of the actual resource artifact with a
    <a href="#Property:hasArtifact"><code>prof:hasArtifact</code></a> predicate and then may describes the artifact's
    format &ampand any specifications it conforms to with <a href="#Property:format"><code>dct:format</code></a> &amp;
    <a href="#Property:conformsTo"><code>dct:conformsTo</code></a> predicates respectively. The role that the resource
    plays with respect to the profile may be indicating using a <a href="#Class:ResourceRole"><code>prof:ResourceRole</code></a>
    class instance linked to it with the <a href="#Property:hasRole"><code>prof:hasRole</code></a> predicate.
  </p>
  <p>
    A vocabulary of <code>prof:ResourceRole</code> instances is provided in <a href="#resource-roles-vocab"></a>.

    The namespace for PROF is <strong><code><a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/dx/prof/">http://www.w3.org/ns/dx/prof/</a></code></strong>.
    However, it should be noted that PROF makes use of terms from other vocabularies, in particular Dublin Core [[!DCTERMS]].
    PROF itself only defines a minimal set of classes and properties of its own.
  </p>
  <p>
    PROF also makes use of derivative namespaces of it's namespace for auxiliary vocabulary elements, such as instances
    of the <code>prof:Role</code> which are within the <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/dx/prof/role/</code> namespace.

<section id="motivation" class="informative">
  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>
    Until this vocabulary's creation, there was no formal W3C method for describing the objects (Internet resources)
    used for <a>profiles</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are a multitude of ways to describe the components needed to define a profile and support validation of data
    to profiles, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>human-readable documents stating requirements (e.g. [[PDF]]) </li>
    <li>usage and guidance notes</li>
    <li>
      machine readable constraint languages (e.g. the abstract (Dublin Core's Description Set Profiles [[DCDSP]]) or
      the more concrete (SHACL [[SHACL]] &amp; ShEx [[SHEX]]).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Describing the components within a profile via documents or constraint languages does not indicate many things
    either important or interesting to know about a profile such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>its dependence on standards or other profiles</li>
    <li>inheritance of profile information from the things being profiled, or</li>
    <li>related profile resources
      <ul>
        <li>
          guidance documents in addition to formal constraints
        </li>
        <li>
          equivalent constraints written in different constraint languages for different forms of resource, e.g. SHACL
          for RDF and Schematron [[SCHEMATRON]] for XML.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    With a mechanism to relate profiles to specifications and other profiles, profile hierarchies can be established
    which will:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      assist with the reuse of existing profiles
      <ul>
        <li>
          one can profile another profile, adding a small set of additional constraints and declaring compatibility
          with all profiled specifications.
        </li>
        <li>
          reducing the total effort and information necessary to specify a profile
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      allow for machine interpretation of profiles and automated profile negotiation with fallback options
      <ul>
        <li>
          if a client requests a profile which a server cannot deliver, a server may be able to instead deliver a more
          generic version of the requested resource, using a profile link to the thing it profiles
        </li>
        <li>
          a client may be able to generate a request that already indicates acceptable fallback options for resources
          when the primary requested profile is unavailable
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <section id="motivating-requirements">
    <h4>Motivating Requirements</h4>
    <p>
      For the purposes of dataset exchange and with the lack of a formal W3C method for describing the objects related
      to profiles, the DXWG undertook a process of Use Case and Requirements gathering. They established the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/">Dataset Exchange Use Case and Requirements</a> document
      (the UCR document) [[DCAT-UCR]] which groups requirements for profiles into the following sections:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#ProfileAbstractRequirements">6.10 Profiles — abstract requirements applying to the general definition of profiles</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#ProfileFunctionalityRequirements">6.11 Profiles — Profile functionality</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#ProfileDistributionRequirements">6.12 Profiles — Profile distributions</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#ProfileMetadataRequirements">6.13 Profiles — Profile metadata</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      PROF addresses many of those Requirements &ndash; those that can be addressed by describing
      profile components and relations &ndash; and those Requirements link back to the Use
      Cases that motivated them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The UCR document lists a further profiles Requirements section:
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/#ProfileNegotiationRequirements">6.14 Profile and content negotiation</a>
      however those are not addressed here but by the related [[PROF-CONNEG]] document.

  <p>
    This vocabulary is for describing relationships between standards/specifications, profiles of them and supporting artifacts such as validating resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    The model takes the <code><a href="http://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#terms-Standard">dct:Standard</a></code> Class as a starting point and defines a specialization, a <code>Profile</code>, which is a <code>dct:Standard</code> that <em>profiles</em> a <code>dct:Standard</code> or another <code>Profile</code>. <code>Standards</code>s or <code>Profile</code>s can have <code>Resource Descriptor</code>s associated with
  them that define rules for implementation, provide guidance on how to implement, or play some other role. <code>Resource Descriptor</code>s must indicate the role they
  play (to guide, to validate etc.), the formalism they adhere to (<code><a href="http://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#terms-format">dct:format</a></code>)
  and any <code>dct:Standard</code> that they themselves conform to (<code><a href="http://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#terms-conformsTo">dct:conformsTo</a></code>).
  </p>
  <p>
    Any <code>rdfs:Resource</code> MAY indicate conformance to a profile as per <a href="#eg-conformance-to-profile"></a>
    by using <code>dct:conformsTo</code>. Individual communities MAY determine what constitutes an appropriate URI to
    identify a profile.

        The property <a href="#Property:isTransitiveProfileOf">prof:isTransitiveProfileOf</a> defined here performs a role
        similar to that of the property <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#semantic-relations">skos:broaderTransitive</a>
        defined in [[SKOS-REFERENCE]]. That property "...allows communities of practice to exploit transitive
        interpretations of hierarchical networks..." while freeing the simpler hierarchy property of
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#semantic-relations">skos:broader</a> from having to enforce
        transitivity which would prevent broader but non-transitive relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
        Figure 4.5.2 from [[SKOS-PRIMER]], reproduced below, illustrates the general principle of use of
        <code>skos:broaderTransitive</code>.

        This vocabulary defines <a href="#Property:isTransitiveProfileOf">prof:isTransitiveProfileOf</a> to allow for the
        transitive interpretations of hierarchies of Profiles (of other Profiles and Standards) while freeing the
        simpler property, <a href="#Property:isProfileOf">prof:isProfileOf</a> from having to enforce transitivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this vocabulary provides this <code>prof:isProfileOf</code> &amp; <code>prof:isTransitiveProfileOf</code>
        pair of properties, it does not specify how a particular implementation of a Profile that is related to another
        Profile or Standard by <code>prof:isTransitiveProfileOf</code> should implement specific inferences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inference based on <code>prof:isTransitiveProfileOf</code> will be more complex than inference based on
        <code>skos:broaderTransitive</code> due to Profiles being complex objects relative to SKOS Concepts.

# A profile that is within a hierarchy of profiles may wish to indicate it profiles
# things "further up the chain". To do this, prof:isTransitiveProfileOf can be used
# to indicate anything the profile is related to by a series of one or more
# prof:isProfileOf properties.

# Here the New Zealand profile of the ISO addressing standard is presented in a chain
# of profiles:

                  addressing standard, ISO19160-1:2015 (Address)""" ;
  prof:isProfileOf &lt;http://linked.data.gov.au/def/iso19160-1-address&gt; .

&lt;https://www.iso.org/standard/61710.html&gt;
  a dct:Standard ;
  rdfs:label "ISO 19160-1:2015 Addressing -- Part 1: Conceptual model" .

# Now, according to the semantics of prof:isTransitiveProfileOf, using the
# prof:isProfileOf statements above, one can infer the following additional
# statements:

&lt;http://linked.data.gov.au/def/iso19160-1-address-nz-profile&gt;
  prof:isTransitiveProfileOf &lt;http://linked.data.gov.au/def/iso19160-1-address&gt; ,
                             &lt;https://www.iso.org/standard/61710.html&gt; ,
                             &lt;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#&gt; .

# These statements may help consumers understand which broad, well-known
# profiles data they have conforms to when they are presented only with its
# conformance to most specialised (lowest) profile in a hierarchy which they
# may not understand.

# In this example too, a user of the profile
# &lt;http://linked.data.gov.au/def/iso19160-1-address-nz-profile&gt; will also
# understand that data conforming to it is also conformant with OWL which is not
# in the direct hierarchy of addressing standards (iso19160-1-address-nz-profile >
# iso19160-1-address > ISO 19160-1:2015) but is critical to know about when using
# the specialised standard as it can indicate reasoning possibilities.

      DCAT-AP, a profile of DCAT, has itself been profiled for various European countries, such as Belgium who has
      issued <a href="http://dcat.be/">DCAT-BE</a>. Additionally, there are several domain profiles of DCAT-AP, such as
      [[GeoDCAT-AP]] - for describing geospatial datasets,
      dataset series and services - and [[StatDCAT-AP]]
      for enhancing interoperability between descriptions of statistical datasets. Further to this, there is even an
      Italian profile of GeoDCAT-AP, <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/news/geodcat-apit">GeoDCAT-AP_IT</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This profile hierarchy is represented graphically in the figure and RDF (turtle) below.

      Since there are no cardinality restrictions on either the property <code>prof:isProfileOf</code> or other restrictions on the class definition of
      <code>prof:Profile</code> that prevent them from being used to represent polyhierarchies, Belgium could release a
      profile of [[StatDCAT-AP]] (e.g., StatDCAT-BE), that would be both a profile of DCAT-BE and [[StatDCAT-AP]]. This
      imagined profile, '?' in the figure above, would not be a profile of GeoDCAT-AP.

        This example uses a dummy profile created for this document to show how PROF describes profiles created

      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The DCAP Guidelines document "explains the key components of a Dublin Core Application Profile and walks through

      application profile" which is what PROF does.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this example, a dummy profile of Dublin Core TERMS [[DCTERMS]] is created to characterise documents in a
      hypothetical "ePublish" platform. The dummy profile contains many parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a profile overview document</li>
      <li>a <em>How To</em> document offering guidance on how to use the profile</li>
      <li>two constraint language files - both conforming to DCAP's constraint syntax in plain text and RDF (turtle) formats</li>
      <li>two profile description files - one an image (the <a href="#fig-eg-csiro-dummy-dcap"></a> below) and the other an RDF file (the example RDF below)</li>

    </p>
    <p>
      Communities commonly make profiles of the International Organization for Standardization's standard
      ISO19115-1:2014 Geographic information -- Metadata -- Part 1: Fundamentals used for cataloguing spatial datasets.
      <a href="http://www.ga.gov.au">Geoscience Australia</a>, Australia's national geological survey agency, has
      created a profile that constrains ISO19115-1:2014 in ways such as making optional properties in the standard
      mandatory for profile conformance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GA Profile of ISO19115 is published online as a collection of resources with an index document with the persistent URI
      <a href="http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/def/schema/ga/ISO19115-1-2014">http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/def/schema/ga/ISO19115-1-2014</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although not initially formulated with PROF in mind, nevertheless the various parts of the GA Profile of ISO19115
      can be characterised using PROF as per <a href="#fig-eg-ga"></a> and the example RDF below. Note that the
      persistent URIs assigned to the profile by Geoscience Australia are used within the PROF description.

      PROF is considered a specialisation of the revised version of the Dataset Catalogue Vocabulary [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]]
      for the purpose of cataloguing profiles. With this in mind, the main PROF classes - <code>Profile</code> and
      <code>Resource Descriptor</code> - specialise (are sub classes of) DCAT's <code>Resource</code> and
      <code>Distributions</code> respectively. This alignment is not normative, but is provided as a recommended way
      to consider general metadata needs when describing profiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      These specialisations are indicated in <a href="#fig-align-dcat"></a> below as well as the data element mapping
      table that follows it.

      Due to PROF being aligned with the revised version of DCAT and ADMS also being aligned with DCAT, classes and

      <code>dcat:Resource</code>, albeit that the latter is such via being a sub class of <code>dcat:Dataset</code>
      which subclasses <code>dcat:Resource</code>, means that resources could easily be dually typed as being of both
